3,"Post: My ex used to shoot back with ""Do you want me to go with you?"" all the time, no matter what it was. I almost wonder if I blocked out him asking me that about our own wedding.

My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all.

I actually ended up really liking her which has been rare for me lately, so this is something i would like to hold on to if at all salvageable.

I think spending time with other people than me is good for her, but she is so afraid of ruining things for others.

However, my sister always sneaks alcohol into the house anyway, and is drunk by nightfall. Then the arguments start.

124,"Post: I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made.

She’s been remembering some things from her childhood, and, with the help of her therapist, is trying to process and heal. We don’t live in the same area, and when we got together about a month ago, she filled me in on some of those issues. About a week later, she told me that she was taking a break from electronics in order to try to process and heal, and that she and her therapist had been talking about it for a while.

287,"Post: Are there federal or state (IN) laws that govern shelters for shelters that don't accept any federal funds?

There are so many things going on here that don't seem legal, and many more that are totally unethical. I've been here for a month and here's just a couple of the things that are jumping out at me: * Our meds are kept locked up in a cabinet in a room accessible only by staff and ""resident staff"" (which also seems like a HUGE conflict of interest.)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from stress?"" is "," no.

288,"Post: This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date.

290,"Post: She literally said that I don’t even count as a boyfriend. --- Fastforward to now - or for the past few months to be precise, where an incredibly hot girl messages me on Tinder and asks me out. I delay meeting her and although she said she's fine waiting, she's still completely out of my league, and because I don't want to come off as desperate, I let her message me most of the time.

291,"Post: Almost too well. She extends our date twice, buys us a drink each, starts a make out session which lasts for 2 hours, calls me hot, and although neither of us had a house free she gave me oral too. Although she said she had a great time - which I replied to - I then waited to respond to her next message, and I don't know if that killed any momentum because I was already very delayed when we first got talking of course. Anyway, despite our great date and a second one lined up when I asked her out a day later, she ended up cancelling on me, and then told me a week later that she got more serious with another guy - which to me only translated as him being hot and me being ugly.

292,"Post: She said she always had to message first, and she decided to completely blank me when I apologised, and that was that. The first girl to ever express proper interest in me in my life ends up going completely down the drain. I don't know if it was because of my own management of messages or me being unattractive in general, but despite this great date occurring I only feel absolutely awful because of it in the end.

I must have horrible luck because I experienced two more horrific events while visiting Dar es Salaam...things I won't get into.

And the more I have to go, the harder it is, so I try to go often, like every 30 mintues or hour or so (even at night). I can barely eat or drink anything anymore.
