"Post: How to avoid a relapse? I've been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I've been physically assaulted, I've been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died. I feel like I'm running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out. I feel ""okay"" but I've felt like this in the past and it has turned out that I've just been lying to myself and making things worse. Any advice on how to manage/process my emotions? Or just how to better understand myself?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a significant amount of emotional distress, including experiencing a suicide attempt, multiple traumatic events, and the recent death of a family member. The poster describes feeling emotionally depleted, struggling to cope, and questioning their ability to understand and manage their own emotions. This level of emotional pain, trauma, and self-doubt aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression.

"Post: This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible. I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world. I am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done. Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more? That's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for. I just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a clear and profound sense of emotional distress and hopelessness. The poster expresses a longing for the past when they felt happier and less burdened. They describe a desire to be alone and isolated, and a deep dissatisfaction with the world and themselves. The mention of deleting all social media and wishing they were never born highlight feelings of alienation and self-hatred. The poster also questions the purpose of life and expresses a lack of understanding or appreciation for the joys of life. Overall, the post demonstrates a very severe and pervasive depression that is characterized by deep emotional pain, existential questioning, and a lack of hope or enjoyment."
"Post: Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle. I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it? Thanks for reading."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of disengagement and difficulty finding enjoyment in everyday life. The poster describes feeling disconnected from the present and only being able to think in terms of larger time frames. They express a lack of fulfillment from hobbies and activities that usually bring joy and mention resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms for temporary escape from reality.

The overall tone suggests a struggle with finding meaning and fulfillment in life, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all, I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this.. So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help. In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement. Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm.. I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair. The poster details their long-standing struggle with depression and social anxiety, which they state has lasted for about 15 years. They express a willingness to seek help through therapy, but also describe the difficulty in implementing the recommended techniques to combat their social anxiety and loneliness. The mention of feeling constantly shuffling around desperately for something that will ""fix"" them and the use of words like ""miserable,"" ""exhausted,"" and ""running out of steam"" highlight a profound emotional distress. The lack of support from friends and family further exacerbates their feelings of isolation. Overall, the post exhibits many symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, such as chronic sadness, hopelessness, and difficulty finding enjoyment or relief from daily activities."
"Post: I dont understand how people can be so interested in so many things First, let me apologize for formatting issues, I am typing this on mobile. I generally find television boring, have little to no interest in Netflix shows, anime, and most video games and hobbies. I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to, and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows. If I watch something of my own, its typically something I watched from when I was younger, like scooby doo or Phineas and ferb as the two main ones, being my absolute favorites from my youth, though that's rare as it is. And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it's just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track. I don't think I have a short attention span, but that's what I always feel like I go back to in the back of my head, as that's what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of interest and enjoyment in various hobbies and forms of entertainment, which can be indicative of anhedonia, a prominent symptom of depression.

"Post: Even if you hate them, theres something gut wrenching about hearing parents fight. I hate both of my parents. They are mentally abusive to me, and just a lack of care most of my life. Even so, listening to them fight right now makes me really uncomfortable. You'd think my hate would just make me careless about it but its just not"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and discomfort. The poster describes their parents as mentally abusive and lacking care, expressing a strong dislike towards them.

"Post: Will I ever be with somebody? I'm so lonely. I'm 19 and I don't have a clue what a relationship feels like. All my friends are talking about marriage and I've never even had a real kiss I cared about. I didn't think I was that bad, I guess I was wrong. I know there are people who go much longer without finding anyone special but I really hope that doesn't happen to me. I've spent so long being someone I'm not, and now I don't know how to actually be myself anymore. I feel so depersonalized and isolated. I need someone to tell me it's ok. I have so many deep problems and I cant talk about them. I don't want sex, I want someone who can hold me and reassure me that I don't need to die to feel at peace. I just want to cuddle and talk, is that too much to ask?? I don't even care who, man woman other I dont care and still I cant fucking find anyone. I can't even find real friends.

"Post: Found out my oldest brother and his wife encouraged my little sister to sleep with a married man nearly 40 years her senior because it would help her learn to appreciate her body and get over past bad experiences.

Post: I am tired of spending every weekend crying. It didn't used to be this bad. I was fine being alone and forgotten. I don't know what changed though. I guess it all just caught up to me. I have felt depressed for as long as I can remember but I was always able to handle it. I am really losing it lately though. Last year was bad. This year is already worse.

"Post: Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself I've had enough. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up. I know I should face my problems but I don't want to and that amplifies my anxiety. I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I don't want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself. There is so many things I'd like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed. There is many things I want and yet I can't bring myself to work and get them. If I oversleep I feel like shit, If I sleep too little I feel like shit. I've talked about my situation with my family and they are trying to support me (I'll start therapy in September) but I can't help feeling like a burden... My motto has always been ""The truth is in the middle"" but I've completely lost any direction and orientation.

"Post: How much longer can I fake it? I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son. I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out. This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants. I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional. Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance. Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015. This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin. This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now). This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work. I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways. I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way. And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple. I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that. I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave. I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents. I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her. I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better. I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me. I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes a long history of struggling with mental illness, including being diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, taking medication, and experiencing side effects.

Post: What is the relationship supposed to be like between a 20 year old uni student who lives at home with his mom and his Mom?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I feel like the friendship I have is fake on her behalf I have known this girl for going on 7 years. I am not the type of person that has many friends, or is very sociable. I try to keep to myself and mind my own business, and don’t care to hag out with people. We met at work, and I liked that there was so much that we had in common, almost like I could see myself in her. We became friends. However, there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship. We are both waitresses, and she would ask me how my night was and how much I made. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable, because the way she asked seemed a bit odd. If I would make more than her she would seem a little upset, if she made more, she seemed to be happy. Even now when I make more than her she says “I hate you”. She says I’m her “best friend” and gets mad if I hang out with someone else without her knowing, tag/get tagged by other people on FB, or go places without inviting her. Although, she does all of these things as well, but I don’t get upset or mention them. When we started working at a different restaurant, right off the bat, there were people that didn’t like me. These are people that are problematic, and always cause drama (which I cannot tolerate). Well, my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back, hated me, and made up rumors about me, decided to invite on them to her house! At that moment I realized that this fakeness was not just in my mind! My friend likes a lot of attention, she gets upset when she doesn’t get it, or when I do; my friend likes to judge other people’s body’s (she’s taller 5’6”, thin); my friend sees every imperfection in others; My friend expects me to invite her out, buy her treats, bring her things to work, but she has never offered to do the same for me (although she does it for others); my friend posted 5 emojis on my fb wall on my birthday (😘🎉 🎂👭💃) I always congratulate her and wish her well; My friend calls me her “bestie”..... how real is this friendship for her?? I forgot to mention that I always try to give her Christmas/birthday presents according to what she likes(mostly earrings or pretty blouses/dresses), she rarely gives me gifts (which is fine, I don’t expect anything in return) but when she does, it’s something that has nothing to do with me (like a size large red and blue Superman-logo hoodie. I’m a size small) or a random item she finds in the clearance section..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The emotional indicators in this post suggest that the poster may be experiencing some emotional distress and questioning the authenticity of their friendship. However, the level of distress expressed does not align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The post primarily focuses on the dynamics of the friendship and highlights instances where the poster feels uncomfortable or neglected. While there is a sense of frustration and confusion, there is no mention of feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or general despair that are typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on analyzing the dynamics of the friendship rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
Post: Does anyone else's depression causes them to constantly daydream or imagine their lives are a documentary? I daydream a lot about people I know in real life or situations I wish would happen. It's alternate reality I go to escape my loneliness. I sometimes daydream about being in a hotel in some tropical paradise or being in a very romantic date or just that I'm in some kind of reality TV show/documentary where I'm the star and the narrator at the same time and everyone admires me. My mental state worsens once the daydreaming is over and I realize it's just fantasy. :/," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post describes a pattern of daydreaming and using imagination as a coping mechanism to escape feelings of loneliness and depression. The poster expresses a desire for a different reality where they are admired and surrounded by positive experiences. The mention of the mental state worsening once the daydreaming is over and the realization that it was just fantasy indicates a disconnect between their desired reality and their actual lived experiences. This suggests a possible dissatisfaction with their current life circumstances and a longing for something different, which can be characteristic of depression. The overall tone of the post reflects a sense of sadness, longing, and disappointment, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: first therapy I just had my first ever therapy today and im not really shure if i liked it or not. I tried to be really open and talked about everything but she kinda just went over the fact that i mentioned that i sometimes have suicidle thoughts(which is like the only reason i made myselve go in the first place). Dunno why i write this here, maybe i just wanted to tell someone."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster had their first therapy session and is unsure of whether they liked it or not. They mentioned having suicidal thoughts, which was the main reason they sought therapy in the first place. The fact that the therapist did not address this issue and instead glossed over it suggests a lack of understanding or empathy from the therapist's side. The poster expresses confusion and a need to share their experience, indicating a sense of isolation and potential dissatisfaction with the therapy session. The mention of suicidal thoughts and the need to talk about it further suggests a level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. Therefore, the assigned label would be ""Yes"" for depression."
Post: I’m afraid of my family falling apart after my grandfather passes away I need advice. My mother passed away from cancer 4 years ago now. I have two brothers in their 20s.

"Post: Hi! We are YourAmigo Hi! I’m A.M. and I’m writing to introduce a new initiative named YourAmigo.

"Post: exhausted this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that I’m feeling as it may be the only thing that stops me from trying to hurt myself. I’ve only slept for about 2 hours and I have to be up for work in 30 minutes which is making me feel worse. As my depression has gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parents and since my mom is aware of my attempts to hurt myself, she has taken on a lot of the responsibilities that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that she’s really the only person. I have my boyfriend who has been as supportive as he can be, especially because he’s dealing with his own obstacles and I feel like I’m incapable of being there for him. I keep having thoughts of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he says and it makes me beyond words angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I can’t make me happy, I can’t make him happy and I won’t make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the successes of others because I’m not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If I’m on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really don’t want to live anymore. Everyday I entertain the idea of being in a car accident because I want people to take care of me and love me but I also hate that I want that and wish so badly to be okay with not needing validation and approval from others. I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about was someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I couldn’t even think of how this would affect my poor mother who has been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. I’m eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I don’t think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because I’m a sad sack of shit who has NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and I’m still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. I’m going to start antidepressants I was prescribed re cently and am in therapy (I don’t go as often as I probably should) and while that is good, I’m almost scared of getting better just to get worse again. I’m scared of going on antidepressants because I’d rather feel so much than feel nothing at all which is my predicament. If this doesn’t work, if I keep waking up depressed and if I continue to get worse, I really want to just die. I have no friends, they all live far away and I think they only care because I think they can tell I’m depressed based on some statuses I’ve posted. My boyfriend continues to be loving towards me, but I always feel like he only does now because he doesn’t want to hurt me. He says he wants me to get better and be more confident, and I can’t help but feel that maybe he deserves someone who is more confident. He reminisces on the past and is always talking about wanting to travel and I can’t help but feel so bad thinking that I won’t be involved in those plans because I’m not a fun person to be around. People have reassured me that I am more than enough but I’m not, I’m not I don’t believe them.

"Post: Thinking of quiting my job I work as a waitress and it's killing me inside. I have anxiety along with depression and having to answer phones, greet customers, small talk etc is just exhausting for me. I also don't get along with some people there. My boss and the chef mainly. I get really anxious the entire day beforehand (work evenings) and it just puts me in a bad spot. Another reason for wanting to quit is I'm currently a student and I'm in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just don't want the stress of having to go deal with my boss and having to take orders etc when I have this important deadline coming up. The only problem is it's my only income.

"Post: Failure to trust ‘’those on my side’’. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I’d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes: - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You’re always spinning the same old tales, you’re driving yourself insane. - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous. - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety). Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side? I"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Alcoholic dad It's been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few ""real"" friends. My dad's problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn't know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don't even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn't just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn't have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren't home or watching people play games.

"Post: I got my first birthday present ever today from person outside of my family So I turned 21 yesterday and today I meet up with friend and he wished me happy birthday and gave my nice bottle of Prosecco. (I Love it) I never ever received gift from person outside of my family for birthday, so I was little shocked. :) I think my life is slowly getting better. ;)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing a positive event, receiving a birthday present from a friend. However, the response still concludes that the poster suffers from depression. This may be due to a few reasons:

1. Context: The post mentions that receiving a birthday present from someone outside of their family is a first-time experience. This suggests that the poster has not had many positive interactions or experiences with others, which may be indicative of depression.

2. Limited improvement: While the poster mentions that their life is slowly getting better, the use of the phrase ""slowly"" implies that they have been in a negative state for a significant period of time. Their explicit mention of their life getting better suggests that they have been struggling or facing difficulties prior to this positive event.

3. Emoticons and language: Despite the positive event, the overall tone of the post still seems somewhat subdued. The use of emoticons like "":)"" and "";)"" may be an attempt to convey happiness, but the addition of ""little shocked"" and ""slowly getting better"" implies that their overall emotional state is not completely uplifted.

In summary, while the post contains a positive event, the overall tone and context suggest that the poster may still be experiencing depression. The limited improvement and lack of previous positive experiences outside of their family indicate ongoing emotional struggles."

"Post: Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago. I'd say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends. For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids. We have literally been talking for nearly 2 years straight. I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now, but i just moved 1 week ago and she has bearly talked to me once. She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is her husband. I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me. and since i wont have internet for a while, im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard.. I did confront her about this though, but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games. Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face. My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years.. Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i've lived alone for since i was 16. Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this: MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me. Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart. The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental. I have a very strong mind, so it takes alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry.

Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them?

"Post: Friend Abandonment Issues Hey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn't mind so much then because I wasn't super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn't afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a 'big city' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn't hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became 'close friends' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now. Now, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn't reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is ""I'm just too busy"" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I've introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don't understand why he all the sudden doesn't seem to care about me. I don't feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were 'too cool' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I'll ask them about things they're doing in their lives and won't be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they're less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it. Here's the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I've done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don't know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing. Im very confused why this happens. I don't know if I'm doing something to encourage this. When I say 'close friend' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it's healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don't understand why I can't hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed. As a side note: since this has happened with my 'close friend' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it's making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together. I wonder- is that a symptom of living in a big city where everyone is trying to 'make it?' I think that, but then I'll hear"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does exhibit some emotional indicators that could be associated with depression, such as feelings of hurt, confusion, and a lack of good friends to turn to. The poster describes a pattern of their close friends gradually abandoning them or treating them differently, leading to feelings of being less respected and cared about. They express envy towards their girlfriend's ability to have close friends and a desire for close friendships of their own. These emotions suggest a level of emotional distress and potential self-esteem issues commonly associated with depression. However, it is important to note that this post does not provide enough information to definitively diagnose depression, and it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment."
"Post: My daughter is entitled and ungrateful Last weekend my 21 year old college daughter fell and was taken to the hospital via ambulance. We got a call from the hospital and my wife and I drove 4.5 hours to spend the night with her in the hospital. While there she had to go to the bathroom but called a nurse because she had to use a bed pan. Just before she went she asked us to leave the room and my wife and I refused because we wanted to get a cute photo of her on the bed pan to post to Facebook and compare to a baby photo of her when she first learned how to pee. She got very upset and called the nurse and told her to remove us from the room. This upset us, especially my wife but we tried to keep out composure until she was released from the hospital. We dropped her off at her apartment and my wife spent the 4.5 hour drive home crying because we can't believe how spoiled and selfish our daughter has become."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. The primary focus is on the daughter's behavior and the parents' reaction to it. While the parents express feelings of disappointment and upset, there is no indication of prolonged emotional distress, hopelessness, or lack of enjoyment in life. The tone of the post is more focused on the daughter's behavior rather than the poster's emotional state."
"Post: Does anyone else relate to this? Does anyone else relate to [this?](https://m.imgur.com/a/KeSMV) I feel my life is so boring and goes nowhere (and in circles at the same time), just as depicted in the photo."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of boredom, dissatisfaction, and feeling stuck in a repetitive cycle. The poster describes their life as ""boring"" and ""going nowhere"" which indicates a lack of fulfillment or purpose.

"Post: Are my struggles even legitimate? [rant] I have been wondering that for a long wile, after a friend told me that there life had been worse so I had no right to be the way I am. And yes I have had a better life then a lot but dose that lessen my experience and hardships ? Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ? Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over !? Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?! Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?! I know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me, I know I’m wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me, don’t you think I know that ?! Don’t you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?! Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?! Just because things are moving forward and good for now doesn’t make my feelings and inner turmoil go away ! Do you think I wanted/want to be this sad excuse of a human being ?! I can’t say anything to anyone, I have learnt that I not only feel alone but I am alone, people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway, so I guess I’ll have to go back to bottling everything inside again, maybe when the glass brakes and I cave i will be free, maybe I will find my freedom in death....idk anymore I just don’t know ....sorry for the long rant and thanks for reading if you did..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains numerous indicators of very severe depression.

They describe inner turmoil, trouble with their mind, feeling alone and unconnected, and a constant belief that they are not good enough. The post also includes self-deprecating statements, thoughts of death, and a sense of hopelessness and resignation.

"Post: Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time. Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong. That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses confusion and hurt over their best friend ignoring them, there is no mention of significant emotional distress such as overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, or lack of interest in activities. The focus of the post is on the friendship and the confusion surrounding the friend's behavior, rather than deep-seated feelings of despair or emotional numbness commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more focused on seeking understanding and discussing the situation rather than expressing profound emotional distress."

"Post: Group of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between... So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward! My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend. I’m not sure they really are my friends anymore as they haven’t been there for me recently so I suspect I’d be next on the chopping block anyway."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of betrayal, hurt, and conflict within the poster's friendship group. They describe the exclusion of a close friend and their disagreement with the group members' judgmental behavior. The poster feels torn between wanting to remain friends with some members of the group while also feeling the need to stand up for their excluded friend. They express a sense of isolation and uncertainty about their own place within the friendship group, as well as doubts about the authenticity of the remaining friendships. The overall tone of the post suggests emotional distress, feelings of guilt and powerlessness, and a lack of support, all of which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Relationship with my Dad Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him. I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue. He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. Thank you."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there are feelings of irritation, frustration, and a desire for independence from the poster's father, it does not prominently display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on the interpersonal relationship dynamics and the desire for autonomy rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: Should I go to the hospital? [please respond] Minor living with adult sibling right now. Idk whether I should go to the hospital. I’ve had suicidal urges surface recently and I’m afraid that I’ll succumb to the temptations and kill myself. But the hospital just seems so miserable, and my psychologist told me if I wanted to go I’d stay until my parents arrived (2 weeks). Also do you get to use your phone and computer in the hospital? Idk what to do. I’m trying to find reasons to live but am falling short. Help."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of desperation and imminent danger, as the individual is experiencing suicidal urges and is unsure of whether they should go to the hospital. They express fear that they will succumb to these temptations and harm themselves.

The post also includes a question about the conditions of hospitalization, suggesting a level of apprehension or uncertainty about seeking professional help. Overall, the post exhibits signs of severe emotional distress and a need for immediate assistance, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly with suicidal ideation."
"Post: My mom went to go to a family gathering (I didn't go) and one of my aunt's seems to have forgotten my name. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this? I don't see my dad's side of the family that much after I moved because its a long commute. However we still send out Christmas cards and two of them call from time to time. One of my Aunts was having a retirement party and my mom went to it out of obligation more than out of wanting to. The Aunt who the party was for was welcoming and nice to her but the rest were just talking amongst themselves about politics and other crap. One of my other Aunts who lives outside of the area (compared to us and the others) went up to my mom and said hi to her but when she asked about me she said ""How's your daughter?"". Everyone else who asked about me asked about me by name,so my mom took notice of this and found it odd. She told me about it when she got home and it bothered me. I was the flowergirl in the wedding for this particular Aunt, so I don't see how she could not even remember my name anymore. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this? I used to send them christmas cards (and I signed my name) but they haven't sent anything back in recent years. I don't feel like bothering to even try now. They send us things asking for money for their kids school from time to time but nothing else."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses some annoyance and discomfort over their aunt forgetting their name and the lack of reciprocation in sending Christmas cards. However, the tone of the post is more focused on seeking validation and understanding of their feelings, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress or a deep sense of hopelessness. The post also includes specific details about family dynamics and past experiences, which suggests that the poster is able to articulate their thoughts and engage in self-reflection. While the post may reflect some negative emotions, it does not align with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Made grandma feel old XD Setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy. I'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke. This resulted in two things. 1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect) 2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol. What made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster suffers from depression. The tone of the post is lighthearted and filled with anecdotes about a humorous interaction at a family gathering. The poster reminisces about a funny moment involving ordering alcoholic drinks and the reactions of family members, including their grandmother. There is no indication of emotional distress, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: Are there any youtubers that vlog about their mental illnesses? I'm currently watching Domikazee R. And Maya Imani-Amani.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

This indicates a personal interest in the topic and a potential desire for support or validation from others who are experiencing similar struggles. While the post does not provide explicit details about the poster's own experience with mental illness, the fact that they are actively seeking and consuming content on the topic suggests a level of emotional connection and potential identification with these YouTubers.

"Post: Post graduation depression is real. It's been 5 months after graduating from college and I've never been depressed more than ever. Unemployed and feeling worthless. Parents are forcing me to get a job already, Peers landed their dream jobs / found a job that pays well and earning more money than me. The feeling of being worthless is overwhelming. Crushing. While unemployed, I've finished a free short course on graphic design and got my certification after passing the assessment and currently doing one on web development. I want to learn more skills in order to land a good job. But I don't think my parents would understand, as they want me to get a job already, any job (Customer Service Representative jobs are a trend in our country which most of fresh graduates end up, I'm not detesting that kind of job but it ain't my thing). I'm depressed more than ever. Fucking anxiety. I've been avoiding my peers because I don't want them to see me unemployed and broke. I'm anxious because I don't think I'm worth it and anxiety had been a problem for years. I'm depressed because of the pressure my parents are giving me. I'm mad because nobody understands me. I'm sad because I don't have anybody. I'm afraid because I might end up a loser in the end. I'm a mess because of the all of the above. (God. I sound like a whiny bitch on my first post here on this subreddit.) Anybody else feeling like me?

"Post: Annoyed and I feel absolutely horrible about it My parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state. A little over a year ago, my father found a job back in the state where I currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works. As much as I love my parents though, sometimes I really struggle with sharing my limited space, i.e. a very small one bedroom apartment. What makes it even more difficult is the fact that I rarely ever know ahead of time when he's coming and when he isn't. And when he does come, he doesn't knock. He just walks right in using the spare key that I came home to find was gone (without first being asked if it was okay to take) a while back. It honestly makes me feel like I'm twelve again. I worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now... I don't. I hadn't even been on my own for a year when all of this started. I can't say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying, ""You'll be fine. We're family."" And the one time I even indirectly said something to my father, just by casually asking if he'd taken my spare key, I got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with. Long story short, I don't know what to do. I feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation, but I am."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does express some frustration and annoyance with the situation of sharing a small living space with the poster's father, as well as feeling a loss of independence.

Having trouble finding a stable career but i’m optimistic. Tried getting a masters degree but it’s not working out so far. Anyways what i’m trying to say is that on paper my life seems ok, but i’ve tried a few therapists, medications and nothing is getting me out of this hole of low mood, motivation, and occasional thoughts. I still skip meals, eat junk, sleep inconsistently, have days where i’m ready to quit everything. I do have little people to talk to and feel connected with even though i have parents, and some friends. It’s been several years now like this. Does it get better?

"Post: I can't stop dreaming about having friends. I don't know why I use this daydreaming technique every single day. I can't trust real people because they always seem selfish to me. I have that weird, twisted image of having a best friend who doesn't judge me and enjoys spending time with me, but it's not real. People are not perfect and I push them away or worse, I don't and they use me or tease me forever because apparently I'm too kind and I act like a stray animal. What should I do? I'm so lost. How can I escape my dreams? I'm 26 and I don't have any close friends and I end up talking to my cats or my plushy because interacting with humans makes me incredibly tense. I'm on meds. I was beaten, I sometimes talk too loudly or too quietly because I was a shut-in for a year and I can't control my voice sometimes, maybe that's the problem? How to quit chatting with my imaginary friends so I'm less lonely and depressed?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a deep longing for friendship and a sense of isolation, describing their use of daydreaming as a coping mechanism. They express a lack of trust in real people and a fear of being judged or used.

"Post: Feel like I have no right to feel this way People have it worse than me, while I, a privileged man with a loving family, cannot feel most of the time. I hate using the term “depressed”. Even as I’m writing this, I feel like I want to delete it. It’s being thrown around so much lately that I feel like I’m just being a little bitch that uses it like I don’t know it. Have been seeing therapists for months, talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently. Thankfully I’m not prescribed any of those fucking pills, because my current therapist is smart enough to know they aren’t the best medicine for me. Whenever I feel joy, it lasts for a minute, then I’m back in my own dark world. Very dark world. I think about suicide, screaming at people, wanting to beat some people up. Then I lay down, and feel guilty for thinking about such horrible thoughts. Sorry for the rant. Today was a shitty day and I had to let it out somehow..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of guilt, self-doubt, and a lack of entitlement to their own emotions.

The overall tone conveys a sense of overwhelming despair, hopelessness, and emotional pain that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
Post: My friend of 16 years thinks I stole from her. I’m at bank every day trying to figure out what happened. So upset. Bank and PayPal are investigating yet she is spreading that I’m a thief. 😢," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a feeling of distress and being upset due to an accusation of theft from a long-time friend. However, the emotional indicators of very severe depression are not prominently present.

"Post: Dear reddit, happiness isn't a choice for everyone I'm sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me. Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it's not. Me or my fellow sufferers don't choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I'm sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think. I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you don't know, that means my brain isn't normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should. I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide. I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice. Then we have comments like ""Just put a life together that wont make you depressed"". I think these piss me off the most. If it was really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people don't mention how hard changing your life can be if you don't have money or resources. TLDR: Stop oversimplifying a serious illness"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a strong expression of frustration, sadness, and anger towards people who believe that happiness is a choice. The poster states that they have a mental illness, implying that they may be struggling with depression. They emphasize that their brain is not normal and they have deficiencies that prevent them from feeling happy, even when they should. The post also mentions how people often oversimplify depression and underestimate the efforts made by those who are suffering. The overall tone of the post suggests a high level of emotional distress and frustration, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Well i think i am good now After a long time with depression (3-4 years) i can say that i am feeling good.i feel that way 4-5 months now but i wasnt sure. My therapist helped me a lot (still visiting her) and my ex-friend but now girlfriend too (even if we have fights often i know at the end that she cares about me). Last september i was ready to suicide i didnt like anything not even smoke weed like i usually do or play video games. I was lying in bed/couch crying all the time and complain that i dont have future and i will be forever alone.Thank god back then my family and my dog(ye my dog,was one of reasons that i didnd hurt myself) helped me a lot.Now i have dreams again i am looking for job i am planning with my girlfriend to move to north europe and ofc i am smiling more than before.

I wanted to share cause i feel really happy and who knows maybe will encourage some people here.Hope!!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a history of depression lasting for 3-4 years and describes a significant improvement in the poster's current state. They attribute this improvement to the help of their therapist and their now-girlfriend, who they acknowledge has conflicts with but ultimately cares for them. The mention of contemplating suicide, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, constant crying, and feelings of hopelessness in the past strongly indicate the presence of depression. The statement that they are not healed 100% suggests that they still experience depressive symptoms, but the overall tone of the post conveys a sense of hope and optimism, which is a positive sign."
"Post: How can I be happy if I have no friends? I'm in my first year of uni and everything has gone to shit. I have friends, but they never want to hang out with me. I ask, and they just ignore my texts or say they're busy. I know everyone is really busy in uni, but I take this so personally. I feel like no one ever wants to be around me. I try so hard to be nice to everyone and it seems like they only return the favor when it benefits them. I try to be my own friend and spend time with myself but eventually it just makes me even more sad. I don't understand why I don't have friends. I've joined clubs and put myself out there and it just doesn't come together. How do I not let this bother me? How can I keep from being lonely when I am so, so alone?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of sadness, loneliness, and a sense of rejection. The poster explains their attempts to reach out to friends and join clubs, but still feels isolated and unwanted.

The tone of despair, confusion, and longing for connection aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, specifically related to social isolation and low self-worth."
"Post: Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night. For about a year now, I've been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening/night. It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so, but it's gradually gotten worse and worse and as I'm typing this it's 9 am and I'm just now getting ready to sleep. I'm guessing I'll wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4. It's really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse. People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed, or even staying up the whole day so I'm very tired by nighttime, but I just can't find the willpower to go to sleep or get up. I'm not motivated to do anything anymore that I don't have to do. I'm starting to feel like a complete failure. Has anyone else experienced this or is experiencing it? (Also I'm taking a lot of melatonin but it still doesn't motivate me to actually get into bed.)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes a significant disruption in their sleep schedule, which is affecting their coursework and overall mental and physical health.

Overall, the post demonstrates a significant level of emotional distress consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: stupid poetry Cast down, cast down. Walk straight but with a frown. Don’t ever think twice about it, Make them laugh, you’re a clown. Cast down, cast down. You’re not worth a thorned crown. Don’t tie a noose but tie your leg, Jump the pitch, dive deep and drown. Cast down, cast down. Annoy them till it’s a ghost town. You’ll drive everyone away, you know? And then be surprised when no one’s around. Cast down, cast down. Watch the seconds, it’s a countdown, Until you crack and have a breakdown, Because everything makes up a meltdown, And your emotions shutdown, And you’ll sit there, And know, That you are, A letdown."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of worthlessness, self-hatred, and a profound sense of despair. The use of negative language, such as ""stupid,"" ""frown,"" ""noose,"" and ""breakdown,"" depict a deep emotional pain and a lack of hope. The repetition of phrases like ""cast down"" and ""you know"" suggest a sense of hopelessness and resignation. The post lacks any positive or hopeful language, and instead, focuses on the poster's negative self-perception and feelings of being a burden or disappointment to others."
"Post: Lost my dad and my pet within the last two weeks. We took my dad to the hospital and found out he had a tumor in his colon. They removed it and several surgeries later he was in recovery, eating, and ready to come home. My mom spent day and night by his side for over a month at the hospital and refused to leave his side. Finally he was recovering and they told her she can go home since they're transferring him to a hospital closer to us. She comes home and the next morning we find out he died in his sleep from a heart attack. After surviving all the surgeries, he dies alone the same night my mom went home. On top of that, we didn't get along well. I'm not even sure he knew I cared about him. All the responsibilities fell on me since both my parents were gone for a month. I didn't have time to drive to the hospital he was at. We had his memorial service and funeral.. then things started to calm down. My mom and I spent time making the house spotless and reorganizing. I woke up this morning to find out that the cat I've had for 6-7 years got hit by a car. I buried him in a box outside our house and now I'm just laying here, wondering if it's going to get any worse before it gets better."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post describes multiple significant losses within a short period of time, including the death of the poster's father and their pet.

"Post: I'm only 16, and I don't have the energy nor the motivation to do anything, and I'm constantly sad. Everything seems bland and pointless, I feel sad constantly, and the things I used to enjoy such as video games, and it's slowly growing old. I've been thinking a lot about the fact that I'm alone and never had any sort of relationship with girls for the past 16 years of my life, and it's really bringing me down. 17 soon, hopefully things will get better with time."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of emotional exhaustion, lack of motivation, and constant sadness.

"Post: Should I attempt to repair our friendship one last time? So a few months ago a close friend and I had a sort of fight because I made a shitty passive aggressive comment. I apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it, even apologised more a day later. Anyhow they said they needed some space, we happened to work together and sit right next to each other. So I left them be for awhile, they basically refused to even look or speak to me. After a month or so this started to take its toll on me, emotionally and mentally I wasn't equipped to deal with it. So eventually after 66 days of this, something I could not get away from I snapped and out of desperation as I was losing my mind I told I'm walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed. So that's where it ended, they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work, they eventually left to go to a new place. Even at the farewell I was ignored till the last 10 minutes then got some communication. After that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group. Completely unexpected, sadly this confused the shit out of me and I drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt. Then I was blocked. I have since not contacted them in any way for over a month. Do I make another attempt and how would I word it or should I just leave it and see if anything happens, we were really close and I feel awful about hurting them. It was the only argument in a year and a half we had."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

The overall tone of the post suggests a significant level of emotional distress and an ongoing struggle with their mental and emotional state."
"Post: I don't like when people ask ""How are you?"" Because instead of saying: ""I googled the prices of veterinary xanax this morning because I'm seeking any kind of relief from this inescapable malaise and self-worthlessness I've been battling for the last 14 years."" I have remind myself that they're not actually asking how I am, and that it's just a greeting and that I have to say ""Ahh, y'know, just living."" so they don't worry. I wish someone would ask how I am and actually care about the answer."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional distress, including feelings of inescapable malaise and self-worthlessness.

"Post: How do I befriend my crush? So there's this girl (21/f) that I (21/f) really, really like. I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me! I have a friend who once had a guy give her chocolate that he “couldn’t finish” when we were in the library. The next day, he messaged her on Facebook, saying she probably felt weirded out by what he did – she responded to him, and they started talking to each other. They’ve now been dating for over a year. The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I've been warned that I should draw a mental boundary between feelings of friendship and romantic feelings, which I’m set on doing. I would do what my friend’s boyfriend did, but with these chocolate chip cookies I baked, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldn’t it? Even with my friend’s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, I’m pretty desperate, as she’s graduating soon, and I really don’t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus. Please help with creative ways to approach my crush (like my friend's boyfriend did)! Thanks!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post primarily expresses excitement and a desire to establish a friendship with the crush. While there may be some underlying feelings of insecurity or uncertainty, they are not prominent or indicative of very severe depression. The tone and content of the post focus on seeking advice and strategies for approaching the crush, rather than displaying significant emotional distress or hopelessness. Therefore, the poster does not appear to suffer from depression based on this post."
"Post: I can't stop thinking about suicide and it's making it hard to do anything I cant get these thoughts of suicide out of my head. The word just keeps popping up in my head. I keep thinking of where I could go, or what effect it would have. I can't get it out of my head. I've been staring at reddit doing absolutely nothing because every time i do something it keeps coming up again and it just distracts me until im slumped in my chair staring or lying on the ground. I used to smoke weed all the time, I like to think it helped me ignore my depression, but it really just made my depression make me more useless than i already am. I don't see the any sort of happy ending to my life. The happiest i can see myself attain is dying alone with a self-published book thats gone unread till I die, then maybe someone will read it. I dont see myself ever finding love, I see friends leaving every minute, every conversation I have with family only makes them hate me more. I try so hard everyday. I feel like im the only one trying. I adapt to my friends, they never pay me mind. I adapt to my family, they dont pay me mind. Its easier staying in my room all day. Where I don't have to exhaust myself in adapting to everyone. Where I don't fuck everything up. I just want to do my homework. I don't want these thoughts anymore. I'm not sure i actually will."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: A letter to a person I let down To The Person I Miss The Most, Happy birthday man, I miss you and I’m sorry. It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It’s a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you can’t ever go back to something you once valued so highly. It’s been a year and a couple months since we’ve talked, and there’s rarely a day where you don’t cross my mind. I’m not saying that’s healthy, because it sure as hell isn’t, but who cares anyways. I wasn’t good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest. Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you’ll never fuckin’ read, pretending in my head that there’s some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It’s like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface. I’m cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I’m doing, and I know that you’re doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed. You’ve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it. I loved you, I don’t think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let’s be honest, that isn’t our style. We’d probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we’d pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I’d be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldn’t critique me, that’s just the way you are. Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they’d never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness. But that’s the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I’m sure you remember that. Here’s to better times ahead, and a letter left unread. Sincerely, Your Old Best Friend"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of deep sadness, regret, and self-blame. The poster expresses a deep sense of missing the person they addressed the letter to and apologizes for letting them down. They describe nostalgia as a painful reminder that they can never return to the past and mentions feeling alone, cold, and tired. The mention of wasting time, throwing away opportunities, and not knowing what they're doing suggests a lack of motivation or purpose. The overall tone of the post is deeply melancholic and filled with self-deprecating thoughts, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Should I call my friend out on his bs? My friend is a guy. It seems like he wants to be oppressed so badly. It’s kinda funny but mostly insulting. A few nights ago he was telling me that he was bi-racial (mix of two races, would happen if Mom and dad were different races) even though both of his parents are white af and he isn’t adopted. He told me he has autism and was disabled even though he exhibits 0 autistic traits and I know he hasn’t been diagnosed. When I ask him what his disability is, he always gives shady or different answers. He keeps saying he has schizophrenia but when I ask, he is always like “what? ...... oh yea” like he needs to be reminded about an illness that is supposed to seriously impact his life. He keeps telling me he is gay but after a little drinking he tells be about a girl he has a crush on. It is funny seeing min try so hard to be in an oppressed minority when he clearly is not but it is also really insulting because I am in a minority. I am disabled and have to be on a wheelchair, I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and I’m lgbt. What should I do?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits some emotional distress and frustration, but it does not align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The poster expresses annoyance and skepticism towards their friend's claims of being part of multiple marginalized groups.

"Post: Why doesn't this person doesn't like me? I met this girl through my best friend and we were cool and cordial with each other. Months later, I said ""hey"" to her and she thinks I was being rude or mean to her but I wasn't at all. My friend tells me that she doesn't like anymore and wants to fight me (for no reason). I haven't saw her in months and I thought she would be passed the situation but apparently she's not. She wants to create fake drama between us and tell lies because she doesn't have a good reason to fight me or not be cool with me no more. She thinks i have an issue with her but she's the one who has it with me OVER NOTHING. Why is she doing all of this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I hate it when bad people get rewarded One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all. It's hard for me to stomach. For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake ""love letters"", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also ""catching up"" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business. When I got home that night, I looked her up on Facebook, and...she does have a much better life than mine. In every way. I feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while I've...struggled."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses feelings of hatred, despair, and a sense of unfairness in life. The mention of being bullied in high school and the specific examples of the bully's actions, such as defacing the poster's sketchbook and kicking their food away, highlight the ongoing emotional impact of those experiences.

Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and a negative view of oneself, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: Someone just said “happiness is a choice” to me. What are your guys thoughts on this opinion/argument? I say it’s bullshit.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong negative reaction to the statement ""happiness is a choice."" The poster describes it as ""bullshit,"" indicating a strong disagreement and a dismissive attitude towards the idea. This reaction suggests a possible lack of hope, pessimism, and a negative view of their own ability to control their emotions and well-being. While this post may not exhibit all the symptoms of very severe depression, it does suggest a potential presence of depressive thoughts and a negative mindset."
"Post: I want to tell her, but... Im the kind of girl who doesnt keep secrets from my mom. Recently Ive been keeping a little more. First of all, I’m in seventh grade. Just saying. The first secret I’m keeping is Snapchat. I’m not really supposed to have it but all my friends did so I made an account maybe last month and I use it regularly. I don’t see the need to tell my mom about this :/ But what I want to tell her but am afraid to is that I am dating someone. Last year I dated a boy and she wasn’t mad, she just wanted to know everything. I mean everything. She’d go through all my messages with him, she’d stalk him on Instagram (from my account!), she’d see if he texted me and sit next to me on the bed and watch me text him and tell me what I can and can’t say. I’m not an inappropriate girl. I get straight A’s, I shame on premarital sex and all that. It’s not like I’m a underage whore (trust me, we have those) and I won’t send nudes! I really like this guy and he likes me back. He told his mom we were dating literally the day he asked me out. My best friend and her crush (who likes her back) already told their moms about each other. My mom won’t let me date anymore because it’s a “distraction” and I don’t need to be “messing with hormonal boys” WHICH I’M NOT ! (Also I text this guy on SnapChat, that’s another reason I can’t tell her I have it because then she would demand my password for it and then look through all my messages on there.) I just wish it would be as easy for me as it is easy for them to tell my mom. Its making me feel super guilty because just yesterday she told me “I love you. You’re such a good daughter.” Which she’s NEVER told me before and she hugged me which she never does unless she wants something. I’m literally just trying to have some fun in middle school like everyone else. :( Please help."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes.

"Post: This girl I don't really know walked up to me and drew a heart on my paper I know it's something so small and meaningless but it made me really feel better. My day was really hard and some portions I felt as if I was going to start crying. I despise myself and the fact that someone can walk up to me and draw something kind of sweet and cute on my paper makes me feel less gross and insecure. Sadly my awkward self didn't respond very fast and by the time my brain was able to form a ""aww thank you"" she walked away. Thanks Trinity, that was really nice, it really did make me feel better."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Post: I have gone days without talking to anyone I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I can't get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I don't talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I haven't talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I don't talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and don't take them away completely. I don't sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I don't care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I couldn't do it. I don't know how to go on living.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Being Manipulated Hi, so, I recently met this new group of people, and it's been pretty nice being with them, but there's this one girl that I have a crush on. About a week ago, one of my friends whom I have known for ~4 years told her, and she said there was a high chance she would go out with me, and has been telling me stuff she has said, and he said that if I was going to ask her out, I should wait 1-3 weeks. Well, recently, they seem to be getting closer and closer to each other, and I have heard that he has a crush on her as well, and wants her to date him instead of me, and when I asked him about it, he got all defensive about it. For a little bit of extra context, he said that he wouldn't ask her out, but would be open to dating her. What should I do? Edit: He said he was trying to get her to go out with me, and said he was helping me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: The one upside of being depressed I've recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression. See, I've started not ""sweating the small stuff."" For example; stuck in traffic? It's okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Doesn't phase me. My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time. Or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head. Since I came to realise this, I've noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I've become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post discusses the upside of being depressed, suggesting that the poster is currently experiencing depression.

"Post: Is it unhealthy to try and solve other peoples issues instead? I find that the worse I feel, the more I try and solve other people's problems. Is this unhealthy for me? It's always other people's mental issues that I'm unable to fix but I feel like I have to try."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a pattern of behavior where the poster tries to solve other people's problems, particularly their mental issues, in an attempt to cope with their own feelings of unhappiness. This behavior indicates a potential lack of boundaries and a tendency to prioritize others' well-being over their own. The mention of feeling worse and unable to fix the mental issues of others suggests that the poster may be taking on more than they can handle, leading to a potential neglect of their own needs and emotional well-being. This pattern of behavior, along with the questioning of its potential unhealthiness for themselves, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as low self-esteem, excessive selflessness, and difficulty finding personal fulfillment or happiness."

"Post: Just graduated university. Anxious and depressed, can't find a job, scared of losing partner over it Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand. I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He's recently told me he doesn't see a future for us if I don't get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I don't even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I'm sad all the time. I can't sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back. I don't know what to do because I want to get better and don't want to lose my bf but I can't even get an interview to work at a high school level job. He has been really supportive and caring but I think he is getting to the end of his rope. I feel stuck and hopeless. Any suggestions?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates several indicators of depression.

"Post: I went to College for Political Science. Now I can't stand politics. When I started college in 2012, my goal was to join the foreign service to represent my country to people abroad. I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country. I can't even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I can't find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved. While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I didn't get a scholarship and didn't graduate. I would get a job, but I don't have a driver's license and public transportation doesn't go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I can't pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death. My student loans are of a type that are forgiven if I die, so my family would save more by just paying to have me buried than to pay off my debt."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling intense shame and despair about their country, to the point where they express a desire to be dead rather than associated with it.

"Post: Two things kept me alive today Firstly, I have not yet hiked across Iceland. Secondly, if I were to be gone, who would feed my fish? Nobody would, they’re like dollar fish. They’d die and then thirteen other lives would be on me. So here I am. I don’t know if it’s sad that literally those two things are about all that keep me here or good that I can still find humor in all this."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reflects a significant level of emotional distress and a sense of hopelessness.

"Post: My mother died...Left me more the siblings My mother died recently. She had a retirement account and life insurance. I have two siblings.

Both siblings left long ago. One out of state and one out of the country. I was the only one around for my mom for more then 15yrs. She got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal. I was the only one here to help. Her last year and a half was very tough and I was her full time caregiver. I gave up a everything. As a business owner I Lost most my clients, compiled a mountain of debt and now I am alone to care for her house ( I gave up my place) and pay the mortgage.

My mom told them before she died that I got the lions share but he says he didn't think it was this much of a disparity. I don't know what to do or how I should feel. She always told me she had her reasons. Part of me thinks that fair isn't always equal and I want to tell him that. At the same time I don't want to feel entitled or like I deserve something more. I don't know what to do if anything. I don't feel like I should give them some of my inheritance.

"Post: Fucked up Families- Mamas From Hell We all got that fucked up incident in our families, right? Well, Imma vent about mine, cause it real fucked. For me at least, right, so am a naive virgin eighteen year old, wanna yknow experience sex and dig a guy and stuff, so I go on the dating apps and meet a lad, real nice too, sweet and that, I obviously am attracted to him. So we date and do all the couple stuff like movies and sex and I am on cloud nine cause he an older man so like am cool at school (super super shallow and lame but yknow, naive virgin eighteen year old trying to live up to social pressures exerted by my peers). Anyway, I like the dude, and we fall for each other, we married now with kids so we chill. Right, so a month or two in, he gets all funny on a night out and makes us go somewhere quiet away from our mates, which I dont catch onto cos yknow am like shitfaced and cant feel my face so I dont realise nothing is up at all. Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda.

"Post: How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore? I have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL. Let's call them B. B has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say. For the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn. Also, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends. Another thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to. I went off on a tangent there, didn't I? So basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.) B has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean? Anyway, thanks for listening to this ranty thing. It took ages to write."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of emotional distress and dissatisfaction with the poster's current friendship. The poster describes their friend as ""boring"" and expresses a desire for a best friend with whom they can have more interesting and enjoyable conversations. They also mention feeling suffocated by their friend's clinginess and their struggle with social anxiety. The overall tone of frustration, desperation, and the desire to distance oneself from the current friend suggests a significant emotional struggle that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I (28) did a DNA test on 23andme it told me I had a cousin I didn't know about. My BF and I decided to do DNA tests because they were on sale for black friday. We got our results back last week. I said yes to see family relationships. Turns out I have a cousin in the system. She reached out to me for information but I didn't even know she existed. Her bio mom says they she isn't ready to be in contact with her. From what I gather it was a teenage pregnancy and my grandparents forced her to give up the baby , moved her to a house for unwed mothers and moved the whole family away from their hometown to avoid embarrassment . I think it was a very traumatic experience for her and she may not want to bring up those memories. I feel stuck in the middle now and don't know how to deal with the situation. I suffer from social anxiety and this whole situation has caused me panic attacks. I feel bad for my newly found cousin and don't want to break her heart but I can't go around my aunts wishes. I don't have a lot of information about the family that I could pass on without talking to my aunt or other family members. I am the youngest cousin and my grandparents passed away when I was quite young. I'm not super close with my extended family but that's mostly due to my social anxiety , I care a lot about them and don't want to hurt any of them. Help please!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression, including feeling stuck, dealing with panic attacks, and suffering from social anxiety. The poster expresses a sense of being overwhelmed and unsure of how to handle the situation, which aligns with the feelings of helplessness and lack of control often associated with depression. Additionally, the mention of caring about their extended family but being held back by social anxiety suggests an underlying emotional distress that may contribute to a depressive state."
Post: My depression has gotten a lot worse recently and now I can't do my schoolwork. my head just gets super foggy and I feel exhausted. What do I do? I used to be a straight A student. It's like I'm watching my life fall apart in slow motion and I have no control over it. It's only a matter of time.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of despair and hopelessness. The poster describes their depression worsening to the point where they are unable to do their schoolwork. They express feelings of mental fog and exhaustion that hinder their ability to function effectively. The mention of being a straight A student in the past and watching their life ""fall apart in slow motion"" indicates a significant decline in their mental health and a loss of control over their academic and personal life. The overall tone of the post suggests a high level of emotional distress and a sense of inevitability about their current situation, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Nightmares and dreams HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me. Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several signs of emotional distress that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster describes having nightmares as a child that portray themes of fear, vulnerability, and loss. They also mention that as they grew older and their depression worsened, the nightmares stopped and were replaced by vivid dreams. These dreams depict a sense of longing, desire for connection, and the bittersweet feeling of waking up to reality. The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness, longing, and dissatisfaction with their current state of being. This overall tone, combined with the mention of depression and the impact it has on their dreams, suggests a significant level of emotional distress that is consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important). Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services. So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need. I'm sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i'm complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just don't know what to think."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes a history of dropping out of school, self-harming, and being hospitalized multiple times, which suggests a significant level of emotional distress. They express feelings of hopelessness, self-doubt, and a lack of energy or motivation to do basic tasks like showering or getting out of bed. The poster also shares their disappointment and frustration with a new nurse who invalidated their experiences and did not provide the support they were hoping for. The overall tone of the post conveys deep emotional pain, despair, and a sense of being misunderstood, reflecting symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living There have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I didn't really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here. For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse's daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping. Another example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit. Again, I feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this, but mostly I just wish I was the one that was dead."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ",yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a disturbing lack of empathy towards the living and an unsettling jealousy towards those who have passed away. The poster expresses feeling envious of individuals who have died and wishes that they were the ones who were dead. This is a strong indication of a deep sense of hopelessness and despair. The lack of concern for the well-being of the deceased individuals' families further suggests a significant level of emotional distress. These feelings of wanting to be dead oneself and devaluing the lives of others align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.
"Post: It's not like I don't wanna hangout with them I think I'm becoming a bit anti-social. So, I just got a job and my days off are always all over the place. When I finally DO get a day off, my friends instantly call me up and ask if I wanna hang out... the thing is, I just wanna relax. So, I always either say no to them or make up some excuse. It's not like I don't wanna hangout with them, but fuck sake I'm tired and I wanna enjoy my day off on my own. And that's probably not the best thing, I think it's me developing an anti-social attitude."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a feeling of exhaustion and a desire for solitude, indicating a possible lack of enjoyment in social interactions. The poster expresses the need to relax and enjoy their day off alone. While the tone of the post is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing, it does suggest a shift towards a more antisocial attitude, which could be a symptom of depression. However, without additional information or indicators of more severe emotional distress, it would be more appropriate to classify this as a milder form of depression or simply as a temporary decrease in social engagement."
"Post: Only friend who consistently wants to hang out with me--I've started liking him less and less! help? No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case... I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them. We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so... I don't know! Advice, please? Is it ok to just not want to be friends anymore even if the other person hasn't done anything wrong? When I think about hanging out with them even though I know we'd probably do something fun I just feel apprehensive and mildly annoyed."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses feelings of liking their friend less and less, they do not mention feelings of overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, or despair. Their focus is primarily on the dynamics of their friendship and seeking advice on whether it is okay to not want to be friends anymore, even if the other person has not done anything wrong. The emotions expressed in the post, such as feeling mildly annoyed and apprehensive, do not strongly align with the profound emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Movies to fill the hole inside of you Movies I watched because I felt empty inside but afterwards I felt even worse like I just lost someone Mr Nobody (especially this one) Lost in translation I origins Sorry, I dont have too many, Im mostly looking for movies to watch, maybe you have some to recommend"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a sense of emptiness and the desire to fill that void by watching movies. The poster explicitly states that they feel worse after watching movies, indicating a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction from activities that are typically enjoyable. This aligns with symptoms of depression, as it suggests a difficulty in finding pleasure or meaning in things that used to bring joy. The overall tone of the post implies a sense of sadness and longing, suggesting a potential underlying depressive state."
"Post: Why does it take some 6 months to recover, some 6 years, and some never? I know it's because we all have different brains, mental illness affects us all differently. I know some illnesses have no cure. But I recently saw in a youtube comment section one person said ""I've been living with depression &amp; PTSD for 25 years, it gets easier every day blah blah blah blah..."" and someone else responded ""I recovered from depression &amp; PTSD in about 2 years... lmao"" Do those who recover quickly look down on those who recover slowly or can't recover at all? Also is there any more information on why we all recover at different rates other than what I mentioned above?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a deep understanding of mental illness and acknowledges the variability in recovery times for different individuals. The tone of the post, specifically the use of phrases like ""blah blah blah"" and ""lmao,"" suggests a level of detachment, which can be a symptom of depression. The questioning of whether those who recover quickly look down on those who recover slowly or cannot recover at all indicates a sense of self-doubt, low self-esteem, and potentially comparing oneself to others, which are common in depression. Overall, the post expresses a level of emotional distress and an introspective mindset that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: What are some boundaries you have in place with your parents and in-laws? I just recently got married [27f] and my husband's [28m] mother is having a hard time with being in a support role. She has had access to his bank account and a credit card in his name until we got married. I love and support her and their relationship. We do not financially depend on either of our parents nor do they depend on us. I have read a lot about how to set boundaries but there are very few specific examples of boundaries couples have in place that make their relationship stronger. My husband and I are on the same page that our relationship and boundaries need to be the priority but love our family. We do not have children," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not indicate any signs of depression. It primarily focuses on seeking advice and examples of boundaries that couples have set with their parents and in-laws. The tone of the post appears rational and goal-oriented, with a focus on maintaining a strong and healthy relationship. There are no direct expressions of emotional pain, hopelessness, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Light box Do any of you use one, and has it been helpful? Sitting in front of mine right now hoping to get a boost!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is using a lightbox, which is a common treatment for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression. The use of the lightbox suggests that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression, specifically related to changes in light and mood. The mention of hoping to get a boost also indicates a desire for improvement in mood and energy levels, which aligns with depressive symptoms. Overall, the post suggests a possible connection between the poster's use of a lightbox and their experience with depression."
Post: A cool trick everyone should know https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0fb5l_kixv4," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It simply shares a link to a video and suggests that it is a cool trick everyone should know. There is no mention or expression of emotional pain, exhaustion, numbness, hopelessness, or any other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post seems neutral and focused on sharing information rather than expressing emotional distress."
"Post: I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I can’t be successful in anything Last year I stopped being productive at work and it’s now seeping into the rest of my life. I used to receive accolades for being great at my job. I was even at the top in the nation at my job when they looked at my metrics and sales. But now I’m just sad all of the time and I can’t think straight. Every morning I wake up I start the day ready to take it on. I tell myself I’m going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I can’t bring myself to do anything. There are days where I can sit at my desk for hours just thinking about how I should be working on something. But then when I try, it’s like I can’t think straight. The things I used to be good at now don’t really seem to make sense to me. I feel like my brain is literally turning into mush. I started seeing a therapist, I started taking anti depressants, I exercised for awhile, I tried meditating, I feel like I’m trying everting in my power to get me mind right. But my brain is mush and now I can’t be successful in anything I do. School is starting to slip and my friends keep asking why they never see me. My SO keeps telling me to “take small steps” but that’s what I’ve been doing for a year now. It’s not working. I’m stuck in a cycle of waned to be better and “woe is me”."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling sad all the time, having difficulty thinking straight, and experiencing a lack of motivation and productivity. They express frustration and disappointment in not being able to perform well in their job and feeling like their brain is ""turning into mush."" The mention of trying various methods including therapy, medication, exercise, and meditation without success indicates a prolonged struggle with their mental state. The mention of slipping in school, friends noticing their absence, and feeling stuck in a cycle further highlight the significant emotional distress and impact on their daily functioning, consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: 16, no friends, awkward, ugly, anxious, weird, constant anxiety. Give me one reason to live"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of loneliness, low self-esteem, and anxiety. The poster describes feeling socially isolated, awkward, ugly, and weird. The mention of constant anxiety and asking for one reason to live suggests a significant level of emotional distress and hopelessness, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of despair and a lack of motivation to continue living."
"Post: Getting my BA Accomplishment in a reality that uses a perception of truth is mediocre at best. But it is an accomplishment and should be celebrated. I found a lot of like-minded individuals who only run on hope, who understand there are no absolutes."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains a mixture of positive and negative emotions. The poster acknowledges that getting their BA is an accomplishment that should be celebrated, which suggests some level of positive emotion and pride. However, the post also expresses a sense of disillusionment with the perception of truth in society and refers to it as mediocre. The mention of like-minded individuals who only run on hope and the understanding that there are no absolutes can also indicate a deeper level of existential questioning or dissatisfaction. Overall, while the emotional indicators are not as strong as in the first example, there are hints of negative emotions and a possible underlying dissatisfaction or disconnection from societal norms or expectations. This could align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Emotionally offline I shouldn’t be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I haven’t started on any of them. But I don’t have the energy to even get started...I don’t know what to do. It’s too late to ask for extensions but I don’t want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess I’ll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it’s gonna be fucking painful. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I’ve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that’s definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what’s going on in my life, there isn’t much there. If my life had a thesis statement, it’d be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I don’t find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have “friends” but I don’t much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I’m still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I’m also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she’s dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I don’t even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck. The only thing I have is that I’m in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that’s certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I’m also fairly consistent with working out; it’s not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didn’t do it I can’t imagine how depressed I’d be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least. With my career, I’m interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I’m good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it’d be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that’s sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it’s become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that. But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I’ve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I’ve pushed through my whole life and honestly, I’m tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it’s lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I’d rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isn’t good to have hanging over my head when I’m asking all of these questions. I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this. The social life issue is more simple, I don’t even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that’s gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I’ve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I can’t imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me. Isn’t it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I’m like a people’s introvert, it makes no sense. I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains numerous indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling emotionally offline, like a shell of themselves, and struggling with a significant lack of energy and motivation. They express feelings of apathy, hopelessness, and despair, describing their life as lacking fulfillment and anything to look forward to. The mention of being stuck on their ex-girlfriend and feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her new boyfriend suggests issues with self-esteem and rumination. The poster also mentions thoughts of suicide and scheduling a doctor's appointment to explore potential underlying causes of their emotional state. Overall, the post conveys a profound sense of emotional distress, helplessness, and a desire for things to get better, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."" I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout. I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building. I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them. I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing. I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that. I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it. I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college. I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy. I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind. I like the caprese sandwich I'm eating, with melted mozzarella, tomato, red peppers, pesto sauce."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post showcases several positive experiences and moments of gratitude. However, the inclusion of the quote about escaping depression and the mention of the ""unhappiness that becomes too hard to bear for some"" suggests that the poster may be experiencing some level of depression. While the overall tone of the post is positive and focused on things the poster enjoyed about their day, the mention of depression and the reflection on unhappiness indicates that they have likely experienced or are currently experiencing some level of emotional distress."
"Post: Unrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my posts could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friends will read this. Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day. I'm usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response ""I'm sorry, I don't like you in that way."" It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we didn't last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move). Then I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I shouldn't have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting. The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I've been. Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, ""Don't fuck this up. She doesn't need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend."" I said some harsh things, and because of it, we weren't friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost. She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do things together, play music together, video games together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked things over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before. We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friends became great friends of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together. And we've gotten to the level of ""No judgment"" as she calls it, where I've told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets, and she did the same with me. Problem is, as we spend each week almost always hanging out 3 or 4 days out of the week. I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together. She's never dated, but she tells me about guys she's liked, little things that happened to her like small romantic contact like ""holding hands"". She has A LOT of guy friends that she's close with, and a few girl friends that she's really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it's something I'm jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself ""be normal, be funny, don't show any signs that you may still have feelings"" and it works. I'm happy with the way things are, us spending lots of time together, hanging out at each other's houses for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to. But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kids with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dances with, goes to church with, does romantic stuff with just pains me to think about. Well, it's late (like 3 in the morning) and this is the time when I'm usually in my feelings. If you've invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I'm a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I'm an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it's a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she's coming over tomorrow. P.S. I thought about solutions like slowly drifting apart from her, but I've come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. But it still hurts."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional pain and longing. The poster describes the consuming nature of unrequited love and its impact on their previous relationships. They share their struggles with jealousy and the difficulty they face in accepting that they will never be in a romantic relationship with their best friend. The post also mentions feelings of inadequacy and fear of losing their friendship. Overall, the tone of the post expresses a significant level of emotional distress and a sense of hopelessness in finding a resolution to their feelings.

"Post: I wanted to kill myself tonight. I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I've had a very rough few weeks with finding myself jobless, financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that I decided to write this little note in my phone. (The ending is supposed to sound funny, it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I was in tonight) Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food. I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doesn't have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did. I haven't felt suicidal in years and I just need someone to understand where I'm coming from."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses having a desire to kill themselves, which is a clear and significant sign of extreme emotional distress. They describe experiencing a rough few weeks with joblessness, financial struggles, and relationship conflicts, which have contributed to their current state of depression. The mention of being in a ""drunken wine induced depression"" and the lack of anti-depressants further emphasizes the severity of their emotional state. Their contemplation of self-harm, sobbing, and worries about their son and debts demonstrate a deep sense of hopelessness and despair. The fact that they haven't felt suicidal in years adds weight to the seriousness of their current situation. Overall, the post contains strong indications of very severe depression and the need for understanding and support."
Post: I just cried for an hour straight. and god damn does it feel good to have some sort of emotion in me after 3 months of feeling empty.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has been feeling empty for three months, which suggests a prolonged and intense emotional state. The mention of crying for an hour straight can be seen as a release of pent-up emotions and possibly a sign of deep emotional pain. The phrase ""god damn does it feel good"" implies a sense of relief or catharsis from experiencing some sort of emotion after a long period of emptiness. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: My mom has changed since marrying her new husband. I’m a college student, still living at home with my mom, going to school and working part time. I help pay some bills, I help around the house and do errands when I can. Since this new guy moved in with us it doesn’t feel like a family anymore. When they do grocery shopping he writes my moms name all over what is HER food. This never happened before and I really never even touched her food to begin with so I find it really rude and unnecessary. When they buy dinner, they bring back food for everyone except me. (My younger brother lives with us too). And they tend to go out to dinner without asking if I want to go. I don’t know, I’m venting but I’d also like other people’s opinions on this. Is it normal or am I right to be feeling like I’m unwanted?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of being unwanted and excluded within their own family. The poster describes changes in their mother's behavior since marrying her new husband, including him marking food as his and not including the poster in dinner plans. These actions can contribute to feelings of being left out and unimportant, which may have a negative impact on the poster's emotional well-being. However, while the post indicates some level of distress and desire for validation, it does not display the pervasive hopelessness, exhaustion, or lack of pleasure commonly associated with very severe depression.

"Post: Falling back into it I'm 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks, and our plans to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she's been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote ""Anon is a piece of shit cunt"" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told. I've fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I haven't experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy. I feel like I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I don't know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it's just me who has the problem, as she's gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said ""ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers"", but I'm still not convinced. I feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. Is there any advice or words of wisdom that I need to hear? I want to get back to normal. I don't know how I'll deal with feeling completely alone again and losing the people close to me emotionally."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a range of emotions that are commonly associated with depression, including intense sadness, self-hatred, guilt, and feeling like a burden or undeserving of happiness. The poster describes a history of depression in the past and compares their current situation to a time in their life when they felt similarly depressed. The lack of support from their family and the fear of losing the one person who understands them emotionally also contribute to their distress. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-doubt, and a desire for advice or words of wisdom suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

"Post: I just need to get this off of my chest. This is my first time posting. I’m not sure if trigger warnings are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mentions suicide. A family member took their life last week and I’m really, really struggling. I’m absolutely devastated that my children won’t be able to grow up with them around. I’m struggling to keep it all together. I just want to cry all day. But I don’t want my kids to see my crying. Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal. I have a history of depression, I’m currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool. When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over articles that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment... if during those last moments they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the “what if?” I’ve been able to stop doing those. But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone. I’ve never had anyone this close to me die. A friend who I had grown apart from committed suicide last year. I was upset,.. but I wasn’t this upset. Let me stress this - I am definitely not having any suicidal thoughts. Due to the unexpected costs we’ve had, I can’t afford to see the psychologist, that’s why I’m posting here. I’m just so devastated."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of severe depression.

While they stress that they are not experiencing suicidal thoughts, the overall tone of devastation, hopelessness, and the need for support indicates a severe level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
"Post: Dead Mom, Schizophrenic Father. I wrote a 1,900 page message but I figured no one would read it. My mother committed suicide because I left home after years of neglect and emotional abuse. I couldn’t go to my father because he has severe schizophrenia and it’s not safe to be around him. I moved across country after my sister who had left a year prior convinced me to do. After I moved across country my sister gave me 2 weeks to get an apartment or she’d kick me out. I got a job and an apartment (with the help of a really shitty roommate) and I had been working practically trying to just ignoring my previous life. A week ago I found out my mother had killed herself and now me and my sister are back to our old home trying to fix all the problems created by her unexpected (I honestly expected it) death. I’ve left all details out because I could fill a fucking book with them but the main point of this post is, I’ve been fighting all my life for a better life but things always seem to get worse and worse.

"Post: Falling in love with someone who doesn't feel the same way is the worst thing I've felt. I've been struggling with depression for quite some time now, but nothing has come close to how shit I feel now. She was my closest friend, we shared everything together. Now we havnt spoken to eachother in over a month and it just amplifies my depressive thoughts. I just can't get her out of my head.

"Post: overbearing male friend So my [f/18] male friend has recently has become increasingly overbearing, acting as if he deserves to know every minute detail about my life and what I'm doing.

"Post: I believe much depression is about a lack of hope 'I don't want to die, I just want to stop existing' Sound familiar? People just want to end the tedium, the suffering of being conscious. But most people would be depressed if not for a goal. I think most people would rather not exist than exist if solely to pick cotton in the sun or mine in poor conditions. But people who are not depressed do these things because there's a goal, a reward afterwards. There's a reason to be alive When 'whats the point?' is part of your mental vernacular and nothing brings a smidge of happiness anymore that driving force disappears and all it leaves is a depression"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Overall, the post exhibits strong indicators of depression."
"Post: Does anyone else have this constant dark feeling lingering over them? Recently my mom died and this dark feeling of hopelessness has been worse than ever before. I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing makes me happy, and I don't want to die but I don't want to exist either. I can occasionally enjoy things, but at the end of the day I just think to myself, ""why am I still doing this?"" Everyone keeps telling me that I have to live for myself and not search for answers through others but I feel like I can't help myself. I feel like no one around me understands what I'm going through. I feel like a robot at work, forcing myself to seem okay. I just feel like living with this feeling inside of me is so hard, and maybe genuinely not even worth it. I don't even feel like taking my medicine or eating heathy or anything. I just wake up, go to work, come home and sleep as much as possible. Sorry to rant on here, I'm not sure what else to do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Somedays I feel fine, others I feel crushing loneliness. I'm 28. Never had a girlfriend and have become distant from my friends. I have no idea of how to meet new people. I just... I dunno, sometimes it feels like I should have my life on track by now. My sisters were married at this point, meanwhile, I never had an intimate relationship nor even a small idea of how to start one. I see people with successful careers, homes, families at my age, yet I feel like I'm just going day to day growing older with nothing to look forward to. I don't want to kill myself but sometimes I wish I just ceased to be. My hobbies don't feel fulfilling any longer and sometimes I just want to sleep the morning away mainly to make the day shorter.

"Post: My brother has depression and I need help I’ll start off by saying I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it isn’t, I’d love if you could point me in the right direction. My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP (can’t exactly remember the name, but it’s a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we can’t sit idly. I’m not sure what the next step is but I’d love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Unstuck yourself I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point. I didn't see the point of doing anything nor meaning of life itself. One day a light bulb went off. I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time. We shouldn't refuse to do things just because we don't understand the point. Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given. Just go do things because we CAN! If you are lonely, go talk to a homeless person. You will be surprised how much you could learn. If someone did you wrong at one time, forgive them and live for the future. Life has so much for us to explore. The trick is to start on one thing. Put left foot before right foot, then next ... You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Am I being a bad friend or is she? Hey, I'm kind of new to Reddit but I kinda need an opinion on a situation and I really hope the person I'm talking about never reads this. I have this close friend, (let's call her P) and lately, P and I have been having some problems. P is annoyed because she thinks I don't spend enough time with her. She's in one of my classes so I see her every other day for 2 hours but that isn't enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her. She gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatory/passive aggressive texts during lunch about my location. Now keep in mind, I'm an honors student and I usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and I barely see my other friends, who I'm much closer to and don't share many classes with, because of this. I'd be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends (who she's also friends with) and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when I try to talk to my best friends. Also, I don't really like her personality sometimes. She's kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons (i.e. this one guy who's really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he wasn't interested). And she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked, to the point where I've stopped talked to him so she doesn't tell me about her dreams in which I make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous. However, she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on. I understand her situation and that she feels like she's losing her only friend but I really don't like being controlled and walked on. I also feel bad about her situation and I don't want her to cry, make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friends/twist the situation (which she has done before) and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that I'm overreacting and a bad friend so I'm posting on here for a second, unbiased opinion. Help?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post describes interpersonal conflicts and frustrations with a friend, but does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses concern about their friendship dynamic and feeling controlled, but does not convey feelings of overwhelming emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair that are commonly associated with very severe depression.

"Post: Dead is better than alive imo. I wouldn’t say I feel particularly sad or depressed, as a constant state. It’s all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe there’s nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive. When you’re alive, you feel so much. Yes, there’s happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there’s also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the “good stuff” about living doesn’t weigh out the bad, in my head. A nothingness after death just seems like the better, more rational option. Am I wrong to think this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a belief that death is preferable to being alive, indicating an underlying desire to end one's life. The poster does not explicitly state that they feel sad or depressed as a constant state, but describes experiencing a range of negative emotions such as sadness, anger, hate, and jealousy.

Overall, the post displays a significant level of emotional distress and contemplation of death, which warrants concern for possible depression."
"Post: Addicted to depression Every time when I feel like the self-loathing and depressive feelings are becoming less, I feel shit because I don't feel depressed anymore.

"Post: Back pain has brought me to a dark space. I’ve been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and I’m 17. I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I’ve played my whole life. I don’t have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I couldn’t bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but didn’t get noticed. Fast forward to now and I’ve gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I’m 17, I’ve gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs. The Summer is almost over and the realization that I haven’t gotten better is bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(&lt;-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I’ll remove this part), and I cry everyday. I do most of those things in private, when no one’s home (excluding the random screaming I do at night). I don’t want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother’s life (He’s 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) I’ve always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she doesn’t need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab). I’ve been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional. (Whatever that means...) Point is, I’m very sad and I feel like I’m getting worse everyday. I don’t know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I don’t have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I don’t know how to feel it. TL; DR: I’ve played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still haven’t healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. I’m not good at anything else."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. The poster shares their struggle with chronic back pain and how it has affected their ability to play soccer, their main passion and source of fulfillment. They describe feeling empty without soccer and lacking any other talents or interests, which highlights a loss of identity and purpose.

The poster also mentions not wanting their mother to worry about them, which suggests a reluctance to burden others with their own problems, a common trait in individuals with depression. The overall tone of the post intensely conveys the profound emotional pain and hopelessness commonly associated with severe depression."
"Post: Massively depressed and looking for low-cost help Hi there, I am not the type of person to turn to the internet for self-help, but I'm at a loss about what to do and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I'm 29 y/o F with a history of depression since age 14. I've been on and off about 3-4 different type of antidepressants and in and out of therapy since initial diagnosis, so neither concept is really foreign to me. I'm looking for a low-cost way to talk about my symptoms, even an alternative to real ""talk therapy"". I was in a MSBP-type situation where as a young adult I was forced into therapy when I wasn't ready, and made to discuss what should have been patient protected information with my family after my sessions, so I'm hesitant to ""get into"" that again after the experience. Advice? Help? Anything?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a longstanding history of depression, with the poster stating they have been dealing with it since the age of 14. They express feeling hopeless and lost, emphasizing that they have nowhere to turn. They mention having tried multiple antidepressants and therapy in the past, indicating their familiarity with these treatment options. However, they express a reluctance to engage in traditional talk therapy due to a negative past experience. This suggests that the person may have developed some level of distrust towards therapy, potentially hindering their willingness to seek help. The overall tone of the post is one of desperation, seeking any form of advice or support, indicating a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: People I love keep dying. I can't take it anymore. On New Year's Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream. I couldn't stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they didn't offer bereavement for people who weren't immediate family. I was so distraught that I couldn't go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It shouldn't be. He should still be alive. Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said ""that's my sweetheart, that's my pride and joy."" I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon. I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left. On July 1st my mother told me that she's been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work. That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down. Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system. But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to them. I don't want to lose my mom. I'm not even thirty. I'm not ready to wake up knowing that she isn't with me anymore. I can't take anymore. I have been crying all day. I don't really know what I expect to see from anyone here, but I'm just so lost."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a deep sense of emotional pain, grief, and despair. The poster describes a series of significant losses, including the death of a close friend, their grandfather, and their mother's recent diagnosis of cancer. They express overwhelming grief and struggle with daily functioning, such as at work, with constant migraines, and a desire to sleep all the time. The mention of seeing a counselor and being on medication suggests that they are already seeking help, but the sorrow remains overwhelming. The overwhelming sense of loss, hopelessness, and desperation aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I have my ECT consultation today and I’ve never felt more alone. I have a good support system around me but somehow I’ve never felt more alone than at this moment. Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that. Last night was the first time I’ve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly I’ve just been miserable and haven’t even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden. I’ve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. I’ve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar. I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that don’t work, when in reality, I’m that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already. I never thought the potential for another treatment would actually make me more suicidal, but here we are. Thanks for reading."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits numerous indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling incredibly alone despite having a support system, indicating a sense of isolation and disconnect from others. They express a belief that their depression is more severe than anyone they know, highlighting feelings of hopelessness and despair. The mention of feeling suicidal, even if not actively planning, suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The poster also discusses the impact of their depression on their life, including losing a career they loved and experiencing difficulty in daily tasks. They express dissatisfaction with previous treatment methods and a lack of hope in finding a solution, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of the post conveys deep emotional pain and a strong desire for relief from their suffering."
"Post: Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now she’s creating a bad environment for me. I’ll call my ex friend Mary. We met at work. I really valued our friendship because it’s hard for me to make friends. I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded. Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago. About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy. They seemed to have an ok relationship. After a year of dating, they started having problems. Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time. She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf. I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her she’ll be ok. She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him. She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her. She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in. I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say. Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Mary’s breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk. Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them. Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and they’d talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so that’s how I knew). I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot. It affected Mary’s work. She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf. Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and don’t wanna tell our boss. But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, it’s usually me who’s left to pick up the extra slack. This went on for 3 months. Honestly, if she wasn’t a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it. It didn’t go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasn’t there for her during this difficult time. I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again. I also told her she wasn’t there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled. She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasn’t capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend. We both walked away mad. She started ignoring me completely. I didn’t think I was wrong but I still felt bad. As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas. The next day, she said thanks and we’d talk soon. The day after that, she was back to ignoring me. Now she doesn’t speak to me or even look at me, just pretends I’m not there. I can’t say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I haven’t told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok. They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me. I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too. Sigh, I don’t know what to do. Any advice?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits various emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses a sense of isolation and difficulty in making friends, which can be a symptom of depression.

"Post: My friend is dating my friend's rapist. my friend, let's call her 'b' is very troubled. i've known her for years and she's always had very severe depressive, suicidal and destructive tendencies. recently, it had gotten to the point where our friendship was struggling because it always felt like i had to be looking for her constantly and making sure she wasn't literally running away to commit suicide (and if i wasn't there for her all the time i felt like a bad friend). anyway, she started talking to this boy (let's name him 's') who I knew fairly well for many bad reasons. He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this. Mostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong. Overreacting, as it's not 100% to do with me - I was friends with him during him and E's relationship but not after I knew of the way he treated her. Do you think I am doing the right thing or should I continue our friendship separately? TLDR: My friend is dating my other friend's rapist. Am I overreacting by cutting off my friendship with her completely?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Feelings of isolation, even among friends How do you deal with the feeling that you don't belong anywhere? That no one ever understands you? I always feel this way around everyone and every group I'm in.

"Post: How do I end this, or can I fix it? ok, so it's kinda a long story.. but me and my best friend met in high school, we clicked right away, there was this bond ( and kinda still is? ) between us, we would never separate, always talking etc. Still in highschool she cut me out of her life sudendly for a whole year. I dont know why I continue trying to talk to her, but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there, and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her, we didnt talk at all about that, she just gave me a note saying why she did that, wich honestly didnt tell much except saying she has depression and didnt know what she was doing...She said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out. Years later, we didnt talk that much as before, but were still really good friends, then I started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her. Sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because I didnt agree with her opinion over an actor... She would rage in games with everyone, and stop talking.. now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life, for like weeks, then come back like nothing happen. She would never tell me whats wrong, if I tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again. Eventually I got tired, and told her that we couldnt go on like this. So I stoped talking to her, 2 months later I decided to give another shot, what happen was exactly the same. So I stoped talking again, and I though it was for good, we only talked when we were with all our friends etc. Then I learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide. She actually tried it, said her mom, and was admited to an hospital. I was heart broken, thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment... So I went to the hospital, and we talk normally.

"Post: My sister wants to have an intervention with our parents about their marriage. So my sister and I are both adults. I'm 29 and she is 26. Neither of us live at home anymore. I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn't exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of ""disrespect."" If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn't religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic. I think an ""intervention"" would just make it worse because I know my dad will see it as a personal attack. I'm of the ""it's none of my business"" persuasion but I don't want to miss out on family time with my parents and sister. We all get together every couple of weeks at my parents house for dinner and board games, which I love. I don't want to lose that. Any thoughts? Is there anyway to approach our parents without making it worse?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Losing my Best Friend Ive been best friends with someone for over 11 years now. Not that the amount of time matters but probably helps to understand why im here. Recently i feel very distant from her. We dont talk as often and well this has happened before but before it was as if we never stopped talking when we did message/meet the other again.

"Post: When boredom turns depressing. Maybe you have nothing to do and you are left to be alone with your thoughts. Maybe you are procrastinating on something and your letting the guilt eat away at you.

"Post: Is this it? Is this really all there is? There is no escaping the struggle of human existence to just simply die and it's all gone to time? Moments of happiness are fleeting and never last. Pain stays with us for longer. Pain and chaos happen to all people. Suffering is a widespread human emotion. Why do we put on a masquerade amongst each other? Why put yourself through an existence of pain? How many lives have been lived in pain and died in them? Nobody asks for an existence, it's thrust upon you. What you do with it makes you who you are, but what life does to you typically makes you live an existence of either easier happiness or rolling agony.

If I had my act together I could’ve graduated earlier. I hate myself so much for this, I always prided myself on keeping my mom from harm but she’s going to be in so much debt. It’s so unfair, if I had thought this through maybe she wouldn’t be in this position. Im so close to graduation but so fucking scared. What if I don’t get a job right away? I always said I’d repay my loans then repay my mom but $52k is so much money. More than I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m just taking advantage of her at this point. I’m such a fucking trainwreak.

"Post: Suicide is a constant thought though I dont feel a desire to do it I have people who I care about and who care about me and I know deep down that Id never consider suicide a valid option but it seems that I can't help but constantly think about it throughout the day, every day. Is this something that leads to the actual act or is it just being in a dark place? I feel so apathetic and when Im not totally numb I feel like there's this pit of sadness in my stomach that Im trying to digest. I dont think I genuinely smile or laugh anymore it's all just reflexes so my family doesnt have more to worry about. I feel like i cant tell people how I am because were all struggling so hard to stay afloat and stay strong for each other and piling more misery on seems like the wrong thing to do. Not sure if Im even looking for answers but it feels good to get it all out of my looping brain"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

I’ve not been nearly as suicidal as past years and I’ve gotten back in school and met the love of my life but the past few weeks/ days I’ve been sinking really bad. Ive distanced myself from my boyfriend and my very few friends. I’ve just laid in bed and thought about ending everything. I don’t know why the sudden lack of will to live. It’s like I’m 15 again and I’m scared any moment I’ll end my life. I don’t want to want this. I have cats that nobody would take and a little sister that would be devastated. I think my future could be amazing but I’m not sure it’s worth feelings like this much longer. I have nobody to call to distract me bc my boyfriend is busy and I’m so scared.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Imminent Death of a Loved One So let me start by saying I’ve been fortunate enough to have never lost a family member or really close friend, so this is all foreign to me. My grandpa has had cancer for quite a while and it’s getting worse. Whenever I visit it’s something that is never really talked about and he seems to not really want to talk about it and doesn’t really let any of us know what is going on and down plays the situation. Recently I’ve picked up on several indicators that lead me to believe the end is near. I don’t really know what the best thing to do is, but I know one thing and that’s that I don’t want to miss any moments, let him down in his last days or regret anything for the rest of my life. He has lived a long and extraordinary life and has so many stories and so much wisdom. One thing is that I want to be able to tell my future kids about him and carry on that legacy after he passes and there are many stories that I can’t myself recite and many that I am sure that I haven’t even heard. I guess what I’m looking for is maybe someone who has gone through this sort of thing and can share maybe some things that they did or wish they would’ve done before their loved one passed away. Two things kind of come to mind but I don’t know how to bring it up. Maybe to have him write some things down in a journal or to record something. I’m also just open to hearing anyone else’s stories. Thanks in advance"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster discusses the imminent death of a loved one and expresses a desire to cherish the remaining time with their grandpa, there is an absence of overwhelming emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair.

Post: Do you ever feel like being hurt is necessary? i feel like i need to be in constant pain and be hurt in order to get my life together and actually try harder even though it hurts so fucking much.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a belief that being hurt is necessary in order to motivate oneself to improve. This can indicate a distorted perception of self-worth and a potential underlying depressive mindset.

Reasoning: The post expresses fear and concern about potentially having children due to the genetic risk of them inheriting depression. The poster mentions that their relatives have been diagnosed with depression, indicating a familial history of the condition.

Post: Unreturned texts An old college dorm friend who started organizing reunions I saw twice last year with other former classmates has not responded to my last two texts including a Holiday greeting to him and his family-- which I consider rude. I made it a point to keep in touch with people especially during the holidays. Am tempted to zap this person and drop him but my wife says to let it slide. I would not say we are close but am perplexed at the rudeness of not even mustering a reply to a holiday greeting even if its fake. I've done nothing to this person except it came out during our last group get together that I went on to get a law degree at an elite school. I never even discuss careers or money at these things if that is the reason. Baffling.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and perplexity at a friend's lack of response to texts and a holiday greeting. While there may be some level of disappointment, the emotions conveyed are not indicative of very severe depression.

At least a small breather from drowning in sadness."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ",yes.

"Post: Am I being too harsh? I have a cousin(we'll call him Joe) who is the closest thing I have ever had to a best friend. We used to do everything together. Throughout the years we would party our asses off in college, spend holidays together, play video games; literally everything together. About a year ago, I started to notice that he was making some bad life choices. Particularly, these bad choices involved drinking and driving, pushing relationships away, and hanging out with the wrong type of people. At first, it didn't really affect our friendship. We've always respected each others separate lives when we weren't hanging out. It was when I started to notice the changes mentioned above that I started to bring it up. One weekend, the whole friendship imploded. Some of my friends were coming into town. Joe was friends with them as well, so I was planning a great time for all of us. Friday, we went out to a local bar and were all having fun. Joe has a girlfriend, who wasn't able to join us until the following Saturday morning due to work obligations. They had been dating for about 3 months, and Joe had been constantly pushing her away, pretending he didn't care about her when I thought she was a stand up gal that could really help him. That Friday night, Joe ends up making out with an ugly, fat, unnattractive old acquaintenance of ours. I confronted Joe and told him to cut the shit or I would knock his ass out. He stopped messing around with the girl and pretended everything was fine. I confronted him, calling him out for how he chooses to make his life miserable with his actions. I forced him to tell his girlfriend what he did. After sending the text, he drove home drunk from the bar. The next day, Saturday, my friends, Joe, and I all met up at a local event in my hometown. Joe apologized to me and said he was glad I was there to make things right. I forgave him and we proceeded to have a great time at the event(which is basically just a big tailgate party). Near the end of the day, Joe's girlfriend was finally able to show up and join the festivities. She didn't seem bothered by his actions of the previous night, which made me happy because Joe needed someone like her in his life. Well, as the evening continued, Joe wouldn't stop drinking. I kept telling him to take it easy, but it was in his head that he wanted to keep the party going at any rate. That evening, Joe ditched me and everyone in the group, including his girlfriend, to go to the bars with some random people he met at the local event. We were all there together, and then he disappeared, gone without a trace or text. He told his girlfriend to wait in a near by parking lot while he finished partying. She ended up calling me, crying, asking me to help her find him. I tried to call Joe multiple times, and was ignored and sent to voicemail. At this point, I'm full of rage from his actions now and the night prior. Why would he treat me, his ""best friend"", and his girlfriend like this? I text him, saying how upset I am and that he needs to be a man and figure his life out becuase he's pushing those closest to him away. Later that night(around 2AM), I get calls from people at the local event that know me saying that he is making out with random chicks again and eventually was arrested by the police. They're telling me to come get him before the police take him to jail. I refuse. Turned out he didn't actual get arrested(so he claimed), I've never found out the truth of that night. It's been over a year since I've talked to him. I don't answer his calls or reply to his texts. When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up. He pretends that his actions didn't completely ruin our friendship. I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle. I won't respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him. My question: Am I being too harsh? Treating him like this breaks my heart. He was my best friend, we had promised to be each other's best men in our weddings. I don't know any other way for him to recognize how awful of a person he has become and to help him learn that he can't live his life like this."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there may be some underlying emotional distress related to the deterioration of the friendship with the cousin, the primary focus of the post is on the cousin's destructive behavior, specifically regarding drinking and driving and the impact it has had on their relationship. The tone is more focused on the cousin's actions and holding him accountable rather than expressing profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The post conveys a sense of heartbreak and a desire for the cousin to recognize their behavior and make changes in their life, but it does not align with the significant emotional distress typically experienced in cases of very severe depression."
"Post: Sigh. Sometimes I just want to fall asleep peacefully to my music, and never wake up. Sometimes I just want someone to talk to and get my mind off things.

Once that happens Ill be back to living my pathetic life again."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

This combination of deeply negative emotions, thoughts of self-harm, and pessimistic outlook align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I Just Want to Feel Normal I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I swear.... And please bear with me. I know this is overwhelming and a lot is jumbled, but I have no other outlet.... I’m so tired of living. I’m not suicidal by any means, and I’m not talking about ending my life or anything, but I’m so TIRED of living in the mental state that I’m in. I can’t afford a therapist, and the ones that have been recommended because they work with your income are awful.... My depression didn’t hit until after my first child was born almost three years ago. Since then, I have been a WRECK, but have gotten much MUCH better over the course of the years. I’ve been on Celexa (60mg) for about a year which helped tremendously, but had to do away wth it once I hit my third trimester of this pregnancy (I’m currently 21 weeks). ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant... —I’m constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat. —I’m constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better —I hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious) —I am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded —I have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance. —Everything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue. Ive tried reading, cross stitching, writing, adult coloring books, ANYTHING to make my life seem more interesting and pleasurable....and I just can’t stick to anything. I’m sorry. I know this post is all over the place. I don’t even know where to start. I just wish that I had SOMEONE to talk to to set me straight Nd to encourage me. My husband tries his best and he does a GREAT job, but he has no idea what it feels like...."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and exhaustion. The poster expresses feeling tired of living in their current mental state and describes a variety of symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as mood swings, self-doubt, lack of motivation, and difficulty finding enjoyment in activities. The mention of being unable to afford therapy and the challenges with finding suitable therapists also suggests a prolonged struggle with their mental health. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-consciousness, and longing for someone to talk to indicates a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: Yesterday was my birthday and no one said happy birthday to me My parents even forgot and I felt so alone :( I turned 21 tho :D," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and loneliness. The poster expresses disappointment and sadness over not receiving any birthday wishes from anyone, including their parents.

"Post: Today I looked in the mirror and thought to myself for the first time ""that's a beautiful person"" Then I played xbox 6 hours non stop and looked in the mirror and thought ""who am I"" I need to stop a lot of habits if I want to get rid of my depression."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a fluctuation in self-perception and a mention of depression.

"Post: I want to convince my family to repair my phone instead of buying a new The phone is okay but recently the touchscreen didn´t work , and i want to recycle using it more time by repairing instead of buying a new one and throw the old one. Its not a super priced phone , but i feel bad thinking how many people throw things because there have a broken element and instead of repairing they buy a new one . I fucking hate trhowing the things that are okay but need a little fix. P.d= Sorry for the bad words"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The main focus of the post is expressing a desire to repair a broken phone instead of buying a new one as a way to reduce waste and be more environmentally conscious. While there is a slight hint of frustration and annoyance, there is no mention or indication of the deep emotional pain, exhaustion, or numbness commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post seems practical and concerned about sustainable consumption rather than overwhelmed by emotional distress."
"Post: Is this kind of family interaction normal? Hi all, I hope you can help me out. Is what my dad said to me normal? Backstory: I'm 24f...married...have a toddler. I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are. Do normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough. The thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are. It feels fake and wrong to me(maybe because I don't think most people actually care about me). They(anyone) can tell me if they don't feel good. I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less. I already feel judged every time I call my mom. And I still get anxious every time my dad calls...thinking he is calling to yell or something. I just CAN'T ask. It literally feel impossible. Like I physically can't get the words out. Comments? Anything to make feel better? I feel down and don't like myself. I don't have any friends to talk to about it either."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster expresses feeling terrible and manipulated by their father's comments, which suggests a negative impact on their self-esteem and emotional well-being. They also mention feeling judged and anxious during interactions with their parents, indicating a possible underlying anxiety disorder. The feelings of loneliness and not having any friends to talk to about their experiences can further contribute to a sense of isolation and low mood. The overall tone of the post reflects a level of emotional distress and dissatisfaction with themselves, which is consistent with symptoms commonly seen in depression."
"Post: I got a job and I made new friends I’ve been sitting on my ass for the last 3 years while my boyfriend supports us both because I could never face my anxiety of job interviews, etc. Some days just getting out of bed is a victory for me. I finally forced myself to try and I got a job! I’ve made two friends so far and I don’t totally hate living right now. Making money and being able to help out is giving me a sense of self worth and I haven’t felt like this in so long. I’m not trying to brag, I’m just proud of myself and no one around me really understands how big of a deal it is. I tried taking a bunch of pills a few weeks ago and I had no idea that I’d be semi (dare I say) happy right now. It can get better ladies and gents, you just have to wait for it, I guess. Idk what I’m saying lol thank you for reading my babble"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains elements that indicate the poster may be experiencing depression. The mention of struggling with anxiety and the difficulty in facing job interviews suggests the presence of mental health issues. The description of feeling a sense of victory in simply getting out of bed and the mention of making friends and feeling a sense of self-worth through work suggests a lack of fulfillment or contentment prior to these recent positive experiences. The reference to attempting to take a large quantity of pills a few weeks ago indicates a history of suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt, which is commonly associated with depression. While the overall tone of the post is more positive and hopeful, the mention of past struggles and the attempt to find meaning and happiness implies a previous period of significant emotional distress."
"Post: I just really need to vent... For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I’ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I’m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I’m asking for help, guidance, I don’t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE... I’m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn’t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn’t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled. My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I’m here today. My, now fiancé, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I’m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), “why doesn’t he move here?,” or “why don’t you move there?” Here’s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I’m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancé visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil’s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. I know I have talked a lot about my fiancé but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said “I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!” Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well,"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster shares a lengthy and detailed account of their life experiences, including a difficult childhood, traumatic events, and challenges in their current living situation. They express feelings of regret, insecurity, and hopelessness, including doubts about their relationship, appearance, and future. The post also reveals a lack of motivation, disinterest in activities, and disruptions in their eating patterns, indicating a significant loss of pleasure and functioning. Additionally, the poster acknowledges a history of depression and describes their symptoms worsening recently. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of overwhelming distress and a need for help, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I'm a [M/17] A guy and I both know each other but never spoke a word, how can I approach him. Before telling you about my problem that I seek advice for, let me tell you about my personality. I don't have any real friends, I just have acquaintances, if you will, people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally, I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most (Science and music) I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself, I was like this since I was a kid, so due to this my social skills aren't great, I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I'd turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However, I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to, as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I'm speaking with, I am good. With that said, over the past year, I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding, I genuinely don't fully understand how this relationship (If you could call it that in the first place) developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library, this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table, so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word, and I'm pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place, days went by and everyday I went to the library I'd sit in the same place and the same goes for him, even when the library was completely empty we'd sit in the exact same place, by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I'm pretty sure we'd feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his, and this is where the bollocks started, we got to see one another way more often, In the corridor, the bathroom, on the way out to the buses, and as we passed by eachother, we'd always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word, we both know eachother but pretended that we didn't. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends, we still wouldn't directly speak but if I say a joke he's going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy, I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke, I'd like to say hi, but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I'd melt, and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don't even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn't like me or consider me a friend, maybe I'm just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning, I don't know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning (I guess we both arrive at the same time). So this is a short version of what happened, this is bugging me and I've been losing sleep over it, what do I do? Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar (English isn't my first language) Thanks in advance."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of social isolation and difficulty in forming connections with others. The poster describes not having any real friends and primarily having acquaintances. They express a preference for spending time alone and feeling happier that way, but also acknowledge the negative impact on their social skills. The mention of feeling anxious or turning red when speaking to new people suggests social anxiety. The overall tone of longing for connection and uncertainty about how to approach the person they have developed feelings for aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: drinking alone who here likes to drink alone but doesn't tell anyone they do because their ashamed people will mock them for doing so? what else do you do to feel good other than drinking?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of shame and a desire to hide the behavior of drinking alone. This suggests a potential struggle with self-esteem and fear of judgment from others. The poster also asks for suggestions on alternative activities to feel good, indicating a possible attempt to cope with negative emotions and seek healthier ways to find happiness or relief. These elements point towards a potential presence of depression, as feelings of shame, secrecy, and difficulty finding enjoyment are common symptoms associated with the disorder."
"Post: Advice Please I've been in a relationship with a woman for some time now, and it's becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty. She has a son from her previous marriage, seven years old. Her previous husband, however, was very controlling and abusive. Her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result. He constantly swears (""fuck, shit, cunt, etc"", just to show how extreme), he's violent a lot, throwing things across the room, he's constantly screaming and shouting, no concept of manners. He'll shout ""give me food now"". His mother, as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband, is too scared to stand up to him. He clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical. He'll often have breakdowns with fits of anger. She lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She's cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she's stupid and doesn't know what she's doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them. So, yeah..... a bit complicated. No idea what to do. As it's very likely that I'll become a step father to this child, I was wondering what advice people could give, or direct me to somewhere that could help. Thanks"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains descriptions of a complex and stressful situation involving an abusive ex-husband, a child with behavior issues, and a controlling and demeaning mother-in-law. The poster expresses feelings of uncertainty, confusion, and a lack of knowing what to do. The mention of becoming a stepfather and seeking advice suggests a level of emotional distress and concern about their future role and the well-being of the child. While the post does not explicitly discuss feelings of sadness or hopelessness, the overall tone and description of the situation indicate a significant level of emotional strain and potential for depression."

"Post: That eternal slumber I’m tired. I’m not here to be saved. I’m nearly 40: have a career, a SO, friends &amp; family who care for me but it will never be enough to keep me around. I’ve been depressed since age 8, my first suicide attempt was at 11 and I’m convinced my life will end by my own hand eventually. I’ve lurked here but never posted. I had to reach out somehow and was not going to call or text the goddamn crisis line. The world sees me as happy and outgoing even when I’m honest about my depression b/c I don’t SHOW it to anyone. I’m lonely. I’m tired. I’m not sure how much I have left to give. I try. I do. I wake up &amp; try to be positive, make the most of each day but I’m just going through the motions.

One of my cats scratching at the door &amp; me trying to hush her so as not to wake my SO. Through the tears I pathetically sliced away at my inner leg a few times. Been a decade since I’ve cut.

Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses overwhelming feelings of fatigue, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts.

"Post: I’ve lost the last of my hope for “my turn”. I (24M) think that without making the conscious decision to, I’ve given up. I think I’ve just reached the point where I’ve stopped kidding myself that it’ll all “get better” or “work out someday” like people always tell you. What I can’t seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything, the one who still believes happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise. I work at a job in an office doing pointless work that I used to swear to myself in high school and college that I’d never wind up doing. 5 days a week I wake up at 7, leave at 7:30, work from 8-5, and get home (at my parents’ house) at 5:30. Then I eat dinner with them, watch TV with them, and they go to bed, so I turn in at 9, watch more TV, and go to bed myself. On the weekends I typically do nothing. When I do go out or hang out with a friend, we do nothing, just sit and watch TV or a movie. Unless we can find some fictional world we can discuss (Marvel, GoT, Star Wars, etc) we don’t even have much to talk about. I maybe have 2-3 friends that I do this with, and again, not too often. I do not currently have, nor have I ever had, anything even resembling a love life. I was foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before I managed to stop kidding myself on that one. I’ve never had sex with or even kissed a girl. The closest thing I ever did was cuddle with a really close friend, and I even fucked that up because I overthought everything as always and didn’t make a real move, and she instantly lost interest/gave up on me, and now we’re barely even friends anymore. I’m an introvert with no desire to change. I have no interest in going out to bars, clubs, or anything people my age for some reason enjoy. All I want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need. My idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl I love and watching Netflix, just enjoying the closeness, maybe some kissing. Sex is something I want but not even on my radar right now. My life goals can be summed up in saying I want to find my “person” have a kid or two, and do what I can to make them and myself happy. I just honestly don’t see the path to that reality, though. Nothing matters to me anymore. Just my parents, and I can honestly say that I am 100% safe as long as they’re around because I care more about them than myself. However, if they were gone tomorrow, I think I’d be close behind. I just don’t see a path out of this pointless existence that I feel capable of taking. I feel like I’m just serving a sentence, going through the motions until it’s mercifully done. No question really. I just felt the need to say it and acknowledge that I’m done. With everything. TL;DR: I’m done, burnt out. Life’s never been good to me and I’ve stopped expecting “my turn”. I see no way to achieve the few things in life I want."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits numerous emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a profound loss of hope and a sense of giving up on the idea that things will get better. They mention feeling like they are going through the motions and describe their existence as pointless. The mention of having no interest in changing, feeling like they don't have a path to achieving their life goals, and not seeing a way out of their current situation all align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The post also mentions a lack of fulfillment in personal relationships and a sense of isolation. The tone of hopelessness, despair, and contemplating self-harm strongly suggests a significant level of emotional distress."
"Post: Is my dad enabling my mom? I have posted on multiple subs about my turbulent relationship with my mom, and I feel like I am afraid of her. I've gotten to a point where I jump when the garage door opens and she comes home from work. I think have become so irrationally afraid of my mom, that fear manifested today when I was going to pick my brother up from work and saw my mom coming the other way. I freaked out and ended up rear-ending another car, totaling mine (I am not hurt, don't worry.) Needless to say, this whole situation has caused chaos in my house and I am terrified to ever get behind the wheel again. Tonight my dad called me out on me calling my mom ""abusive"" a few weeks ago. Bear in mind, neither she nor my dad has ever laid a finger on me, but my mom has emotionally abusive tendencies. She has said things to me that have fucked me up more than she can understand. Here's a short list of some things she's done: * If guilt tripping were an Olympic sport, let's just say she'd be Michael Phelps. * She likes to ask me what's wrong when I'm upset and when I tell her, she cuts me off and says ""I don't want to talk about it."" * She has criticized my weight for as long as I can remember. In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she's not helping. She's only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl. * She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school (""Why can't you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!"") Still does sometimes. * To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn't want to go to Sunday School, she was like ""Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?"" A couple years ago, she told me ""I just want you to go to Heaven when you die."" She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head. * I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with ""How do you know? You've never been on a date before. That doesn't mean you're bi/gay!"" She also told me I am asexual and she's pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don't know whether I am gay or straight anymore. * I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she's basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn't get drivers' license until 18, didn't get my first job until 20, and I'm still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don't fucking blame her! Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like ""What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?"" or ""Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds."" My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist. I don't how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn't buy any of it and blames it on ""liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms."" He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing ""constructive criticism"" with ""abuse."" Deep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don't know how the world outside my little bubble works. I am 23 now and don't feel any better off now than I did when I was ten years ago. There are certain life skills I don't have because they did everything for me. I don't feel like I've ever had to work for anything and I hate them for it. They tried to be tougher with me but didn't have the spine. They never forced me to do anything except go to summer camps for special needs kids, they pretty much just let me raise myself and it's costing all of us dearly. Tonight is the night my real life begins. Basically, if I am so afraid of my mom that seeing her on the road freaks me out to the point of an accident, something in our relationship has gone south. I don't know if it's her or me anymore."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling deeply afraid of their mother and experiencing fear and panic when encountering her. They express a sense of being irrationally afraid and describe feeling emotionally abused by their mother, citing specific instances of harmful behavior. The poster also expresses feelings of resentment towards their parents and a lack of fulfillment or growth in their own life. The overall tone of the post reflects a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."

The lyrics of the song describe feeling trapped in a living hell, enduring pain, and desiring to escape or die. The mention of self-doubt, darkest depression, and waiting for the moment to take one's own life indicates a severely depressive state of mind. The overall tone of the post is overwhelmingly negative, filled with thoughts of death and a strong sense of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: My Wifes Car, Money, and My Brother. What do I do? My wife and I got married, but instead of an engagement ring, we decided I would buy her a car instead. I brought the Toyota and moved in. She already owned another Honda. This way we would have 2. Eventually, she gave her Honda to her brother (who was also in need), and I told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the Honda anyway, not her, so he has every right to own that Honda especially since we had 2 at the time. Keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision, not hers, to let him have the car, because although I'm married to her and her dad bought her the car, I felt like since her dad ""bought"" it, he has the right to it, and since her brother is her dads ""male"" descendant, he has the right to the car. (Sorry we're an asian family) So now we have 1 Toyota (the engagement ring car). With a baby on the way, we decided we would lease another Nissan ourselves, so we could have 2 cars again. Recently my brother was involved the Caribbean island Hurricanes where he goes to Med School, and his whole semester was shifted back to America until either this August or December. So now he's also in need of a car for about 8-9 months. I told my wife that since we are leasing a Nissan, we can let my brother borrow our current Toyota for the time being. My wife doesnt want to give up the Toyota to him in fear that she will lose it. I thought this was unjustified because she gave her Honda to her brother, so why can't I let my brother borrow the Toyota too? Both of us grew up believing in ""helping"" a person in need, and I feel like I went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers, but she didnt let me do the same when it came to my brother. But then again, I feel like she does have a right to the Toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time. After her brother took the Honda, we have been using 1 car for the last year. I figured we could keep using 1 car for another 8-9 months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car. Am I wrong here? Is she technically right? Am I unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wife's decision, since it was a replacement for her ring?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on a specific issue within the poster's marriage and their disagreement with their wife about lending their car to their brother. While there may be some underlying emotions of frustration or confusion, it does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking advice and clarification on the situation rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: Am I in a bad friendship? I have this friend and he's actually really fun and quite an extrovert. He's cheerful most of the time. But the thing is he has anger issues and he gets pissed off at people and stuff easily including me. Whenever i play games like league of legends with him he gets so mad at me for stuff that i didn't even do and even at one point filed a complaint and wrote stuff that was completely false about me. And I used to ask him questions sometimes via text and he'd always respond but then he'd say ""you could've at least said hi"". So one time i just said a simple hi to him and you know what? he said ""I'm really not in the mood for a pointless hi"" and he seemed really moody to me especially for some reason and then he typed something ""you know i really dont know why you bother..."" i couldnt read the rest because he deleted it. But whats weird is he still wants to play league with me and stuff which i find stupid because i know hes just gonna get angry at me again and only me. he never gets angry at anyone else he plays with in that game and it makes me feel sick. So i just stopped messaging him in general. and one time he said ""you know i dont know why im so aggressive to you so lets just forget that happened"" and i didnt say much and he said ""i know you dont have much to say and i dont care so lets just forget"". He didnt even say sorry for being so mean to me. To me it just looked like someone that was trying to clean up the pile of junk he left so he doesnt need to think of it later. It makes me feel so sick to think of. And sometimes he calls me a bitch and a hoe. Like really? Why would you call your friend that? I never called him anything like that. One time he was trying to talk to me and a bunch of other people were talking over him so I couldn't hear him. Then he said ""yo bitch"". I really wanted to punch him in the face that was really hurtful like I have a name cant you at least say my dam name? Sometimes I just hate him so much and its sad because hes a fun person but he just gets stupidly pissed off and says whatever he wants without thinking how hurtful or rude it is."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of emotional distress, particularly related to the poster's friendship. The poster describes their friend's anger issues, frequently getting mad at them for things they didn't do, filing a false complaint, and exhibiting moody behavior. The friend's hurtful comments, such as calling the poster a bitch and a hoe, also contribute to the emotional distress expressed in the post. The poster mentions feeling sick and hating their friend at times, indicating a negative impact on their emotional well-being. The overall tone of the post suggests a significant level of emotional distress and potential negative effects on the poster's mental health."
"Post: Has anyone tried ketamine-infusions for depression? I'm desperate for something other than another magic pill, so has anyone tried ketamine-infusions for depression? How'd it go? How'd you pay for it? Please and thanks"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is desperate for relief from depression and is seeking alternative treatment options. The use of the word ""desperate"" indicates a significant level of emotional distress. The poster also mentions wanting something ""other than another magic pill,"" which suggests a potential history of trying different medications without success. The mention of seeking information on how others have paid for ketamine infusions further highlights the seriousness of the depression and the poster's willingness to explore non-traditional avenues for treatment. Overall, the post reflects a high level of emotional distress and a strong desire for relief, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Told my therapist everything. Told him about my suicidal feelings. Probably said a bit too much because I had to beg him not to call the police. I'm going to get a team and everything. I'm so scared. Be strong, you wonderful people."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has been open with their therapist about their suicidal feelings and even had to plead with the therapist not to involve the police.

When im with others, i try to be interesting, and funny, never harm others or depress others with sad stuffs. I think with friends you can loose up and be yourself. But my BEST friend have something problem with me. I think he dont like who i am, how i behave. Sometimes he notices something about me. What i should have said, or done...like a mother see how her children behave. There was time when he bashed me because i was silent, or because i asked a question about our mutual FRIEND. This weekend we would held a little surprise party to our friend but he said to me, behave and be nice. If i was wrong or bad. Nobody ever told me if i said, done something wrong. Never. He every time say something. He is very sumbissive to others, always go after others. And if he dont like someone, he always talks behind his/her back to me. He has friends i dont. And i feel a sack of ... because of this. I starting to have enough about how he wants me to behave within FRIENDS and pushing this ""you are bad"" feeling to me. I think this is not friendship, he is not my friend. If you are friend with someone, you like him/her who the person is. If i cant be myself within friends, i cant be myself elsewhere. Stepped back from this party, and said im sick. This weekend felt bad because of him. What should i do? (Sorry aim not english, my grammar is bad)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling like garbage and having no friends, along with a profound sense of self-doubt and inadequacy. They express a fear of being judged and constantly trying to be interesting and funny to gain acceptance. The mention of feeling like they can't be themselves and being constantly criticized by their best friend suggests a lack of support and a significant impact on their self-esteem. The overall tone of despair and hopelessness, as well as contemplating avoiding a social event due to their friend, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Humiliated and feeling like a disappointment When people see me out, I feel so humiliated. I have to make up some bullshit story about “taking a gap year before I embark on a career” when really I wanna say “well karen I’m clinically depressed as fuck and worn down to the bone by my own thoughts so thought I should put my life on hold” but no one wants to hear that shit. I’m trying to block out but it’s so hard. I can’t see an end to this, nothing excites me that much anymore and the thought of getting a proper career job terrifies me. I just want this feeling to stop, I can’t take it anymore"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of humiliation, disappointment, and self-disgust. The poster describes feeling the need to hide their true feelings and construct false stories to avoid the stigma associated with mental health struggles. They express intense emotional pain and a lack of excitement or fulfillment from life. The mention of feeling worn down by their own thoughts and the desire for the feeling to stop suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-blame, and desperation aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: Can’t get a job. My patient is about to die. I’ll be out of a job. Can’t seem to get any hospital to hire me as a CNA even though I’m qualified. Had an interview cancelled on me. Can’t vent to my boyfriend or my mom. They make me feel worse and argue with me because apparently I’m just too negative and I’m not allowed to be sad. The depression is getting bad again despite heading into spring and warm temps in Arizona. Can’t keep doing this. The black clouds over me have been here my whole life. I’m sick of it. Just want to end it all. Fuck this life.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of despair, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. The poster describes multiple sources of stress and frustration, from difficulty finding a job to dealing with unsupportive family members. The mention of the depression worsening despite transitioning into a more favorable season and location suggests that the emotional distress is not solely influenced by external factors.

"Post: I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I'm an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job. I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals: Hi everyone, These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know: 1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to. 2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love. So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be. Cheering you on!! ~austen1996 (I can't believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so. It also feels so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academics and don't practice much self-care.....but I felt like this needed to be said)."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly indicates that the poster is struggling with their mental health, specifically with anxiety and depression. They openly disclose their mental illness to their students, expressing a sense of liberation but also a feeling of hypocritical behavior due to their self-worth being tied to academics. The mention of their struggle mentally throughout the quarter and their personal experience with anxiety and depression demonstrates a significant emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I've never really had a personality Honestly can't remember having much of a 'personality' I just remember being a very compassionate and empathetic person when I was younger, but now I've lost that after depression. Everything else about me was always very negative."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a lack of self-identity and a feeling of not having a personality. The poster mentions that they used to be compassionate and empathetic, but they feel they have lost that after experiencing depression. This suggests a significant change in their emotional state and a potential loss of positive traits or experiences. The mention of everything else about themselves being negative further demonstrates a negative self-perception and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I'm going to the party Awhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a"" huge family secret"" that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit. That my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death. This pissed me off and confused me greatly since my mother can't speak up for herself. She died 7 yr's ago. My aunt wasn't even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2. This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years. Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4 kids when they married. Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of. That night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me? So i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn't murdered, my aunt just talking shit. My aunt called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid the suspected murderer might come after her?! Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn't tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn't have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn't keep it to myself. My brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered. The fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us. Well since my brother messaged her, my aunt and my cousins completely ghosted me and my kids over the holidays and everything. Before then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don't get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she's busy. So yesterday my cousins ex posted about a birthday party for her 3 yo son. I msgs her me and my 4 and 7 yo would like to go. She said sure sorry she forgot to invite us. So now I'm about to go and see all of them for the first time since all the bs. Im nervous but I know it's the right thing to do. Give me strength mom and dad!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the post does exhibit emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling anger, confusion, and being upset by the revelation of a family secret. They also mention crying, feeling outcast by their father's family, and praying to their deceased parents for guidance. The overall tone of the post suggests emotional distress and a sense of being overwhelmed by the situation. However, it is important to note that this level of emotional distress may be attributed more to the specific situation and family dynamics rather than a general indication of very severe depression."
"Post: Advice or encouragement for first psychiatrist appointment? Today I booked an appointment to see a psychiatrist, and somehow they had an opening for tomorrow. I’m nervous and have no idea what to expect."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates nervousness and uncertainty about the upcoming psychiatrist appointment. This could be a sign of anxiety or mild depression. While the emotions expressed are not as intense as those associated with very severe depression, the poster's lack of knowledge about what to expect suggests they may be experiencing some level of psychological distress. However, additional information about their overall emotional state and the reasons behind seeking a psychiatrist would be helpful for a more accurate assessment."
Post: How far apart on sibling is to far? So how far apart are you and your siblings and like the title says how far do you think is to far apart for them to grow up together....," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not display any significant emotional indicators of depression. It is a simple question asking about the age gap between siblings and the opinions on what is considered too far apart for them to grow up together. There is no indication of emotional distress, hopelessness, or any other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post is neutral and does not suggest any severe emotional struggle."
"Post: Options for helping my sister in law Initially I wrote out a very long post with all the problems my SIL is dealing with but it really all comes down to this question: With my 13 y.o. sister in law living in really terrible conditions (think 1 step above homelessness compounded by emotional abuse from parents and bullying at school), are there any options for my wife and I to effectively 'adopt' her for an extended period of time? Do we have *any* course of action that would give us rights to house her over her divorced parents?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post describes a sister-in-law living in difficult and abusive conditions, with emotional distress from her parents and bullying at school. The poster is seeking advice and information on options for helping their sister-in-law, specifically asking about the possibility of temporarily housing her. This situation highlights significant emotional and social difficulties, including potential neglect and abuse, which are indicative of a need for intervention and support. While the post does not directly mention the poster's own emotional state, the concern for the well-being of their sister-in-law suggests a level of empathy and potential emotional distress."
"Post: Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do. So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) . Anyway, my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem."" That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets). When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted. We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26. My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.) They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes. I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure. I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy, I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies. I am asking regarding this situation, what should I"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes living with an untrustworthy family member who talks down to them and purposely tries to hold them back from progressing in life. They express frustration and a sense of being trapped, as their uncle asks them to do things that interfere with their work and goals. The poster also mentions feeling restricted and controlled, as their uncle pays the entire electric bill and expects them to pay him directly instead of being able to pay the bill themselves. They express a desire to ensure their money is being used properly and express a lack of trust in their family members. The overall tone of the post is one of hopelessness, frustration, and a desire to escape the toxic environment, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I'm saying. I'm alone as I type this. I'm sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I've been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just didn't care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I've been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I wasn't very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are. Needless to say I don't like who I am. Maybe you don't either. I'm not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I'd like. ""Well, why don't you change?"" Cause I clearly don't fuckin want to. Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I've laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I don't do shit about it. So why complain as if I'm depressed because of it? I think that's where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It's like ""I am this way. I don't like being this way. I don't change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?"" I really don't feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I'd want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g... Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty? I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, don't have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed. It's probably justified that I feel this way. I don't do anything to try and feel better and I don't capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I don't do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There's suicide. But even that holds it's own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It's not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it... It's as if you can't question them. You can't question their pain. Can't question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive. Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it's either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it. You can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they're no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate. I've thought about it a lot throughout my life. I don't think I'd ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just isn't that bad. Not yet anyways.

"Post: How do I stop running away from problems or escape from them? All I do is pile my problems onto future me and live in the present, staying at home all day being depressed, which is still the 'happiest' that I can be.

"Post: Pissed at my wife and mother in law We are new parents with an 8 month old baby. Here is how my wife's day looks like: Take care of baby, clean the dishes, do 1 laundry and cook dinner 3 times/week. Here is how my day looks like: I help around by taking care of the baby at least 2 hours/day so my wife can rest. Other times I work 10+ hours/day because I have a business to run or I clean up the mess my wife makes around the house. Make breakfast and lunch for all. I just found out at our last family gathering that my mother in law said to all my relatives out loud that I don't contribute to helping my wife. I literally lost it. Because she talked about me behind my back and I had no way to defend myself. I'm so pissed off I just want to call my monster in law and give her a pile of shit about how lazy her daughter actually is and that she only knows half the story and that she had no f'ing business talking dirt about me behind my back."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post primarily expresses anger and frustration towards the wife and mother-in-law for their perceived lack of appreciation and understanding. While the poster is clearly upset and may be experiencing stress due to their dynamic with their family, there are no strong indicators of emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression.

"Post: Anyone elses depression feel like this? Good day, This might be weird but stick with me. I suffered/suffer from depression. Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication. The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc. I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head. Here is the opening, (possible trigger warning?), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rob7C1lCYEI As soon as I heard all the voices calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I was like holy shit that was me. I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through. My voice, telling me terrible things, spinning stories, like someone else in my head, working against me. Anyone else feel like Senua/me?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post describes the experience of depression as hearing voices in their head that say mean and awful things. The poster relates this experience to playing a video game that features a main character with similar experiences of hearing voices.

"Post: I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier). I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night. I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was ""all three of you made mistakes"". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied ""ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing."" I have no idea what I've done to make everyone in my life hate me this much. I don't have anyone left and I'm scared to lose the one person that has stuck around so far."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses overwhelming guilt, feelings of self-blame, and a profound sense of responsibility for the traumatic incident involving their boyfriend and once-best friend. They describe feeling sick to their stomach, experiencing sleepless nights, and being emotionally overwhelmed by the situation. The mention of their boyfriend's mental health issues and his subsequent admission to a psychiatric ward adds an additional layer of distress and responsibility. The poster also reveals feelings of low self-worth, ruminating on their appearance, and how it may have contributed to the incident. They express difficulty concentrating and motivating themselves, which can be symptoms of depression. Furthermore, the negative reactions and criticism from others, as well as the fear of losing the one person who has stuck around, further contribute to the overall emotional distress and suggest a significant level of depression."
"Post: I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate? It‘s always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams „You thought, bitch“. I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness. I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions. Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just don‘t vibe with her that much. And I can‘t change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I‘m a broke ass student. I told her once that I don‘t want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it’s all solutions again. „Try this, try that, we need to experiment“. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again. My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter. I really miss that feeling. Now it‘s just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it. But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just don‘t want to go anymore and give up. I don‘t have energy for that. I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings. But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns. I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants. My „new“ therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one. At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I‘d do something to myself. Now no one cares. I‘m alone. I don‘t go outside anymore. I‘m just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I‘m just a bother to everyone. I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself. Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of „Of course, I will try! I will do my best“. I‘m good at pretending nothing bother‘s me and everything‘s fine. I‘m good at pretending to say „Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!“. But I‘m just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more. Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I haven‘t killed myself yet is because it‘d financially ruin my family. I don‘t even care about emotions, I doubt it‘d be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they don‘t get into debt with my death or sth. I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die. I don‘t feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they don‘t put as much energy into me as I put into them. Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really don‘t know how much of this I can take. I‘ve been like this since 6 years old. I‘m 21 now. I don‘t know why I got thrown into this world when I‘m ridden and infested with mental illnesses."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a plethora of emotional indicators that suggest the poster suffers from depression. The individual expresses feelings of hopelessness, despair, and self-hatred. They describe their negative experiences with therapy, the lack of connection with their current therapist, and the longing for the understanding and support they felt with their previous therapist. The mention of suicidal thoughts, past experiences with anti-depressants, and the desire to feel emotional again indicate a deep level of emotional distress. The poster also expresses feelings of isolation, self-isolation, and a belief that no one cares about them. The overall tone of the post conveys extreme emotional pain and a sense of being overwhelmed, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Today I realized I don't have any friends. Not really. This weekend I was going to go to a Harry Potter symphony with my two aunts. One of them and my grandma, who all live together, got sick. They gave me the three tickets. They told me to go with friends, but they don't want to chance getting me sick or no one staying with their mom. Fair enough. As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I don't really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I'm never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway. There's no one else I'd ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I don't know them well enough. I'm taking online classes so no one there either. I don't do anything outside of school or work. I don't even have any friends to take to this fucking symphony. Not even one. I identify more with the characters in the books I read than with anyone I know. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm not even that close with my family, not really. Not well enough that I can even really talk about my opinions and especially not my emotions. The therapist I saw about a year ago kinda threw me off as SAD and said it'd get better. I just dunno what to do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of loneliness, isolation, and emotional distress. The poster expresses a lack of close friendships and social connections, highlighting instances where they are excluded or overlooked by their roommates and high school friends. The mention of not having anyone to invite to the symphony and feeling more identified with book characters than real people emphasizes their feelings of isolation. They also mention not having a close relationship with their family or a therapist, which limits their support system. The overall tone of desperation, hopelessness, and uncertainty about what to do suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: How can i connect with my sister? We live in different worlds. She's two years older than me. We've always been close, but never on a deep level. When we were kids, we often played. In school, she was sporty and popular. I was bullied and quite. In her teens, she began following the mainstream, wearing the latest fashion. Always wearing makeup and black n white clothing. She craves luxury, but she's not bitchy. She's kind and generous. I like alternative styles. I love spiritually, and science of developing a healthy and peaceful mind. I don't have a need to be like everyone else. I LIKE to be childish. It's so hard to connect to her since we're so different. Any tips or methods to bring us closer?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not display strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The main focus is on the desire to connect with the poster's sister and feeling disconnected due to their differing lifestyles and interests. While there is a mention of being bullied and feeling quiet during school, there is no indication of significant emotional distress or hopelessness associated with depression. Instead, the tone of the post is seeking advice and tips on how to bridge the gap and strengthen the relationship with the sister."

And I’m over here with a horrible life compared to them my family sucks and like if I got into details you would understand I have no friends except them my family is broke and I’m so ugly and I suck at school. I know thing will get better bc I’m only in 8th grade but it’s just so hard to be friends with these amazing girls when your constantly comparing yourself and lowering your self esteem. And not to mention snapchat is the worst when ever one of my friends is hanging out with another it instantly ruins my day. I honestly just want advice on how not to be so jealous and how to be more happy because Ik my life doesn’t suck and I’m not a 30 pound kid in Africa drinking dirty water."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post displays multiple indicators of emotional distress and self-esteem issues. The poster expresses feelings of jealousy and compares themselves negatively to their friends, emphasizing their perceived flaws and shortcomings. They also mention having a ""horrible life"" compared to their friends and highlight their family's financial struggles.

"Post: Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life. This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together. I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago. Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her. I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better. We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more. However, she is so messed up. I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her. She was my best friend after all. So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative. Why? Because she no longer wanted to have my baby. In August, she fell pregnant. This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date. That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"". She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated. I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it. She said yes. We went to speak to my mum. My mum asked her. She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future. I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months. But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on. She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons. However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it. Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends. She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me. She didn't speak to me for two weeks. When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff. I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me. Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows. She hasn't spoken to me since. She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me. This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens! She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me. Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice. I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead. I didn't force her or convince her. She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart. Seriously, if you only knew the half of it. The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced. But now, she is living her life. She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos. Maybe she'll do better. I hope not. But I think that's normal. So why this post? Because it is killing me. I don't know how, but I'm still kicking. Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her. She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard. I don't understand what changed. I don't understand she did what she did. Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me? Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility). All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, betrayal, and confusion. The poster describes a toxic and tumultuous relationship marked by cheating, manipulation, and emotional abuse. The mention of feeling broken, in ruins, and experiencing depression and demotivation suggests significant emotional distress. The poster expresses a strong desire to forget about the relationship but admits to being unable to stop thinking about their ex-partner, which further reveals the intense emotional impact of the situation. The overall tone of hopelessness, questioning of faith, and the feeling that the relationship is killing them aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I’ve often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression. When I say I’m sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I didn’t go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity. Turns out, I’ve been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It’s bittersweet, I’ve solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I’m still struggling a lot. I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I don’t think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!) I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. He’s given me depression medication, but I don’t know how much it’s helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it’s just *depressing*. I’ve always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head. Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. It’s a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Here’s to getting through today, friends."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep frustration and disillusionment with the medical community's response to the poster's physical symptoms. The poster shares how doctors have been quick to attribute their pain to mental illness and dismiss their concerns. This suggests a feeling of not being heard or understood by healthcare professionals, which can contribute to a sense of hopelessness and despair commonly associated with depression. The mention of feeling depressed about doubting their own sanity and the discovery of a chronic, painful illness further emphasizes the emotional distress experienced by the poster. The mention of infertility and the belief that the depression did not cause it suggests a cognitive challenge to the assumption that depression is the cause of all their physical problems, adding to the complexity of their experience and emotional state. The post ends with a tone of struggle and a call to get through the day, highlighting the ongoing battle the poster faces in coping with both mental and physical illness."

I have major depression, GAD, PTSD (sexual and verbal abuse) an adjustment disorder, and up until recently, an eating disorder...I used to be on meds... They stopped working... Then I was hit bt a car... Lost two close people in my life... Moved colleges....Then i was in therapy for a long time... My therapist died... And then i lost my job... No more therapy for me.. Recently started again, but Im just finding that I had hoped id feel so much better so much faster and It just feels like I am so raw... I keep going back to thoughts that Im useless... That no one cares... That my life has been ruined because im now perminantly disabled...im constantly in pain and sometimes it's so bad injust want to kill myself to escape it... I have no insurance and no job and most of the doctors ive seen dont care.... I want so despirately for someone to help me... I want to get better and have ANY portion of my life back so I can just fo back to my normal level of manageable anguish I was at before.... Because I cant work anymore I feel like a burden...

I feel like all I do is get in the way... I cant even keep up with housework properly.... I push myself to the point that my back is killing me because I dont want to accept i cant do things anymore.... And then i end up in bed for long periods of time...

Left out. try again. Fall again"" i feel like i have no control over any of the things happening in my life....

"Post: the message i wasnt able to send him. Dear ex, today I found out all the truth. I saw you with her. Why have you been lying to me? Why do you tell me you'd love me forever when you don't. Why did you lie to me that you aren't talking to your ex when I know you have been.. when I saw a message that you sent her that said ""When I'm with her I think about you"" that hurt me so much..I still forgave you. Why did you lie to me about her ""suddenly"" coming to see you when you already knew she was coming to see you? Why didn't you tell me you were going to see her when you told me you were out with your friends? Why do I still forgive you even when you keep fucking up? Why do I love you so much that I didn't mind if you don't love me as long as you were by my side? Why did you even tell me you would make it up to me and gain back my trust when you don't prove anything? Why do you keep telling me so much lies? When were you ever sincere to me? Was I a rebound? Are you happier with her now when you used to tell me she never made you happy? Did you get what you wanted now? Is that why you left me? Am I the only one dying here? While you enjoy yourself when we only broke up yesterday? Did I really meant nothing to you? When I thought you could love someone like me because I can't even love myself. I depended on you and you destroyed me. I gave up everything for you. My dreams, my friends, my family, my time, my efforts, blood, sweat and tears for you. Maybe it's just my fault for not being good enough. Maybe I wasn't pretty enough for you? Maybe I was right.. she was irreplaceable after all. I knew it.. no one can love me. I am not mean't to be loved. I am so capable of loving someone so much but that person is always not capable to give the same love. My heart has been torn apart again. When I trusted you so much with my fragile heart. When I prayed to god you weren't like my previous ex. You became like him.. except you were even worse. Why promise me things that you couldn't keep? Why tell me that you love me when you never did.. I just hope that all the memories we had together, at least just one tiny part of it was sincere. Where you actually loved me and was genuinely happy. I'm sorry again that I was good enough to beat her. I hope you and her will stay happy and be together forever. I just really am never mean't to be loved."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

I'm a 19 years old girl, close to turning 20, never had a relationship in my life and only kissed a boy once. I've had boys hit one me before but I always turned them down. I feel terrible that I've never dated anyone, but in reality I don't even know what my sexuality is and I don't think that I'd be a good partner to anyone. I feel so miserable and sad all the time. I hate my body and my appearance even though I know that I'm not really ugly. I don't know why my self esteem is so low. I don't have energy anymore do anything in my life. I don't have a lot of friends and the ones that I've had in high school I don't talk much to them. I always end up isolating myself from people and the regretting it later. I don't know why I do this. I don't why I hate myself so much. I just wished that I could love myself. I think I'm depressed but I don't know for sure. I went to a psychologist a while ago and all I could do was cry and tell them how miserable I felt and they basically didn't tell me anything and it felt like a waste of money. Anyway, I don't know what I have, I just know that there's something wrong with me. I feel like I've wasted my teenage years away being socially anxious and not connecting with people, and I don't why I am like this. I just wished that I could socialize and be happy and not care so much about how I look and how others perceive me. The year is coming is to an end and I am just feeling terrible because I'm still lonely and depressed and because I'm not in college yet because I didn't study enough for the entrance exam.

"Post: Female reasoning Why does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time. Do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because they’ve “known each other for 15 years/since freshman year” etc. I don’t believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship, but I do feel it is much harder for a male, for several reasons. Men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting, that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop. A mans “natural desires” and wants, can easily blur the lines, and when in the right environment/setting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc. I don’t see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening. Do women honestly feel because of a long friendship ensures its innocence? Or just an excuse/reason given in an attempt to “justify” or have that friendship accepted by their significant other."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It focuses on exploring the dynamics of platonic friendships between men and women and questioning the notion that a lengthy friendship guarantees innocence.

"Post: My favorite friend left our friend group? He is kind of cocky, and selfish, but i like the guy and i saw him as kind of this professional extrovert because he is just so confident and knows lots of people and i kind of looked up to him for that. He made a valuable asset to my friend group of 4, but suddenly he just left for another friend group, a group that is filled with selfish annoying sport fanatics, and they are very passive agressive towards him, but he seems to enjoy it, even though i think that he would have it much better in our friend group where we all just have fun with eachother and just act friendly. I know about letting something go and if it doesn't come back then it wasn't meant to be, but i really miss the guy.

Recently I've felt like nothing matters in the end, and nothing I do makes a difference. We're on a random rock floating through space in a universe thats bigger than we could ever fathom and we don't understand, and we think that things that we do matter. I feel like I've heard ""just because nothing matters doesn't mean you can't be happy"" a thousand times, and while it sounds good, I can't get passed my negative view on things.

"Post: Help with/what to do about toxic sister? (Sorry for sloppy wall and if this isn't the right thread) As the title says I don't know what to do about my 29 year old sister. She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen. Can someone please, PLEASE help me?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a high level of distress and frustration regarding the poster's toxic sister and the responsibilities they have to care for their 2-year-old niece.

"Post: The divorce talk The wife and I have had a very empty and distant relationship over the last few years. After a couple of very difficult circumstances in our lives we sought counseling several times which didn't help at all so we resigned ourselves to being basically roommates for the sake of our children.

We're going give ourselves X months and set aside time every evening to really talk about the things that bother us, the things that brought us to this situation, what we fear for it kids, what we want for our lives, all of it while doing it best to accept/not judge the other person. We have not really spoken to each other like this since before the kids so this may help. If this doesn't change the relationship we'll decide whether we'll separate or divorce.

"Post: I hate myself, just a vent, going to delete I don't even want anyone to read this. I guess all I ever wanted was for someone to want me around. The only way that's probably even possible is if I'm useful at anything. Problem is I am a grade A screw up. What am I even saying? I am incredibly short fused, I feel like I'm slowly burning alive. I'm just angry all the time. So people don't want me around, because frankly I'm an asshole. I hate who/what I am and violently hate myself. It's like I live in an abusive relationship with myself.

And those people around me always think that I’m just trying to act deeply, or being cool. They ask me to become “normal” but I still don’t get what kind of “normal” that they mean.

"Post: Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it. Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority. I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: How To Get Over The Pain I ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could've been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place. She's Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything's fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight. I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her. Well, I bust my ass on this book for months. It's the most important thing I've ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she's only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she's going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn't in the first place, and she's totally shattered my trust. I freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don't make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I'd put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign. Well, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don't need to police her time, and I should've known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter. In it she said she'd done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn't want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn't want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn't want me to talk to her, and she was ""closing her door to me."" I felt supremely judged, i.e. ""My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you're the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me."" I felt like I'd been un-forgiven, ""Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!"" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon. I left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I'm most mad at myself, because I wish I'd just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn't stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I'd disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you're supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she'd sent me gospel I needed to abide by. I said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said ""Which problem is more in need of fixing?"" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I'd declared her typesetting ""a failure"" before I even saw it, and insisted she'd done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she'd made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn't know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn't say ""Forgive thine enemies, until you've got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them."" (I'm agnostic.) She said she'd already apologized (implication being that I couldn't forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed ""YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!"" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to ""handle my shit"" and called me a toddler. Previously he'd admitted to me in private that he wouldn't hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism. The next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I don’t hate my life? I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September. When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.) Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t. Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to “budget cuts.” My first time experiencing adulthood. Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place. What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around. No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for. The depression kinda spiraled out of control. I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another. My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together. I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early, I’m doing noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check. But despite all that, I want to kill die still. I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week. I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment. And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk. (My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Does anyone else's depression show itself as exhaustion? I find as I get older, that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive. As soon as things start going downhill, the unexplained tiredness hits and I become like a zombie. I have no energy to do my normal daily tasks, the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain; I barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space. The physical lethargy always comes hand-in-hand with the Brain Fog. Forget trying to study, forget going through the bills, my brain can't handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down Reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or Netflix.

"Post: what is going on with my mom? As I've gotten older I identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up, but I'm not really sure I'm in the right for noticing this. I have no idea what this is, I haven't met many other people that do this. But my Mom will do this thing where, the happier I get, the less comfortable she is around me. She tries almost frantically or rabidly to cut me off mid sentence or like ""steal my affectation."" Like mirroring that is a bit too eerily similar. Its almost like a ""being a person contest."" I always feel like, gross afterward. Like someone got in my head and took a part of me then did a parody of it. It seems like nothing is going in, and only like warped versions of what I just said are coming out. Like her identity is being threatened or something. And it's only when I'm happy. She seems completely comfortable when I am depressed, and its still all out, no in. It's like she's doing a one man play. I mean I could be overthinking this, I just don't know. Is anyone skilled with like psychoanalysis or something? It seems surreal. I've rarely seen people do this. Am I doing something wrong? Like, am I not being a person right or something? She seems so unnerved by signs of happiness. It almost makes me feel fake or something. It legit feels like I'm beating her at tennis or something. Like the more emotion I am feeling naturally, she tries to one up me. And hers does not feel natural. It makes me uneasy. Is there a reason a person would do this? I really am eager to know what this is or how I can avoid it or make ends with it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Can we talk about comments for a minute This subreddit has helped me so much and it has helped thousands of people just the same. It is supposed to be a place of understanding and help, but when I see comments saying ""tough luck"" ""boo hoo poor me"" or anything of the sort I just infuriates me to the extreme. If you're not here to help or be helped then simply leave, this community is for helping those in need, not for trolling or for laughing at.

"Post: Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?) Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. And that's when the Aha! moment came. *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else. So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Unsure how to talk to friend about something they're doing, or well, not doing. [Advice] First time poster in need of a bit of advice. Sorry this'll be long. So basically, I've been having a bit of an issue with a friend of mine, we've been friends for around 3 years at this point and everything was great! We'd talk every day and hang out around once a week/2 weeks depending on schedules and [my] kids schedules etc. Then about 8(ish) months ago, she got a new boyfriend, and of course I'm really happy for her, she deserves all the happiness! Thing is though, over the last 5 months, there's been a steep decline in conversation between myself, said friend and another friend. Friend #2 and I have been making ALL the effort to make plans with friend #1 and we're getting almost nothing back. We'll text her and we'll not hear anything for days, but she's on Facebook or snapchat posting pictures of her and her new boyfriend, and when she does text back, it's a totally one sided conversation. Like I'll ask her maybe ""how have you been"" and I;ll get a page of text about how she has been with BF and what they've been doing and at the end it'll be ""okay, I got to go, bye!"" If I don't specifically ask her about her baby (who I adore, she's like my niece) I don't hear about her, at all. It's all about BF. Recently, Friend #1 and I didn't see each other for just over 3 months! (did I mention she lives 20 minutes away from me?) No matter how many times I asked her over, offered to go to her house, offered to take her to coffee etc, either the invite went unacknowledged, or she wanted to spend the time with her BF. At that point, I was a bit annoyed but, I understood that people have lives and sometimes things just don't match up. However, the reason I'm looking for advice is because, after not seeing her for 3 months and talking to her only a handful of times, she hits me up and asks if I can watch her baby so she can go out with another friend. (who wasn't even going, she took her BF) I said yes, as I know how it is to want to go out and not to have a babysitter, so my husband and I watched baby over night for her. The ONLY thing I said to her was that I had plans the next day after 1 so I needed her to be back before then. (spoiler: she wasn't!) So I couldn't do my plans and asked friend #1 to stay and hangout since I hadn't seen her for so long. In the 1 hour(!) that she stayed, she called my sister (who I had plans with - we were meant to take my youngest out for his birthday, because friend hadn't come back yet, my sister took him out by herself) a freak! She said 3 times ""imagine not waiting for you!"" I said to her, we'll it's because you weren't back and she blamed traffic for being 2 hours late... On top of the main incident, there's been an incident where she brought a stranger to my house (after I told her I didn't like strangers in my house or around my children) and expected me to be okay with it! She dropped the bomb of bringing this stranger to my house 15 minutes before they arrived and told them I didn't want them there so they felt awkward! (I did try really hard to make them feel welcome, and thankfully the kids had plans so they weren't put in the situation) The advice I'm seeking is - A. How do I talk to friend #1 about this without coming off as bitchy or upsetting her. and B. Should I keep being friends with her? I don't like to give up on a friendship, but I feel like she only wanted me around when she wanted something from me. Any advice is welcome, even if it's me being weird or whatever.

I had a childhood friend since Elementary school, we would hang out often and now she’s a stranger. She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldn’t even take one second to respond “I’m glad your dad is okay?” That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and I’m not sure what happened ! Then this “friend” of mine, never messages me on either Instagram or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate) that they’re both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that “she” loves me, and doesn’t hate me (my friend who doesn’t respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.) But, if this is the case why doesn’t she communicate with me online? Even when I see her, she waved hi to me and we talk a bit, but it’s not the same. There were times in the past where she use to hug me a lot, any time she saw me. But something has changed with her and me, I can tell. I think my friend (the girl I asked out), is unaware of my “friend’s” (her roommates) , true feelings toward me, and I mean that in a bad way. I’m just not sure where I went wrong...."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of confusion, hurt, and isolation in regards to the poster's relationships with their friends. They describe a childhood friend becoming a stranger and feeling hurt by her lack of response during a difficult time with their father's surgery. The poster also mentions another friend who stopped communicating after finding out about the poster's previous interest in her friend. There is a sense of longing for the past closeness and confusion about what went wrong in these relationships. These emotional indicators align with the experience of social withdrawal, feelings of rejection, and self-doubt commonly associated with depression."
Post: Why am I so bad at everything I’m even bad at my own hobbies. I’ve been producing music since like sophomore year of high school and 4 years later I’m still trash. I’ve went to the gym and tried to be consistent but I’m too stupid to work out alone and even though I watch videos on form I feel like my form is always shitty. I’m shitty at talking to people and making friends. Im losing all my friends because my depression makes me distance myself away from people in hopes of them noticing my absence but no one notices. I’m shitty at school. I’m shitty at driving. I’m shitty at talking to girls. I just prefer to lay down in bed and listen to good music that I’ll never be able to make due to my lack of standing out as a producer.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: i Thanks to anyone who read this. I can't feel any emotion: happiness, sadness, anger, nothing at all. Just empty inside. Usually i have something in my head, that keeps thoughts inside, but now its nothing here except my inner voice. If i imagine this, it looks like a big endless gray room with voiceless me and my clone somewhere in that room. Sometimes i think i can cry, but i can't even squeeze out a tear. I can show emotions, but feel nothing inside. I can smile if someone makes joke, but it's made up smile. I don't think friends know more than i told them, but i know there is something they hide from me. I go to school, but it ""feels"" like everything just passes around me, like i don't exist. I don't want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it won't happen to me... I can't control anything. When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fills void called hunger. I can't remember anything happened to me last 4 days. Is it bad memory or nothing really happened to me? Days ago i had thoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts, but they are gone now. Same with feelings. All i have now is emptiness. It hurts so much."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post portrays a sense of emotional numbness, emptiness, and detachment. The author describes feeling ""empty inside"" and unable to experience any emotions.

I've tried so many things to get myself out of this rut but I just can't. I really don't know what to do anymore I feel like i have lost all hope. I've been to a doctor before and got medication but I didn't want that to be the first solution. I guess I expected my doc to have the answer for me to get better. I didn't take the meds because the crazy side effects and again I only wanted to take them if I absolutely need them and the doc didn't even try anything else.

"Post: I didn't expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume I made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression. I mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who don't. What I didn't imply was that I wanted that just for the sake of ""curing"" my depression. And that's what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you're depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships aren't a magic cure. I don't want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression, I'm going to therapy, taking antidepressants for 6 years now and I am fully aware being with someone isn't a cure ( I was with someone while depressed for 2 years ). I wanted to reply to this person to explain they misunderstood me, but I was too upset, so I deleted the post. Perhaps my wording was not good enough, but still, such a judgemental approach to answering someone's post on a depression subreddit is in my opinion very saddening. Just wanted to share this now, take it as you will."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses frustration, hurt, and feeling misunderstood by other members of the subreddit.

"Post: It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end I’m done. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like I’m not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard. I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army. So what’s my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can’t find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible. I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I don’t even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over. Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wan’t to end it all but I don’t want to end it all. I don’t know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

The poster describes the difficulty in crawling out of their negative feelings, the overwhelming nature of the negative voices and emotions, and the inability to find the strength to fight anymore. They mention considering suicide but also express uncertainty and a desire for help, mentioning the possibility of going to a psychologist.

"Post: Love is what makes the ride worthwhile Without love, why suffer through anything at all? For what gain? I've had love, and I lost love. Love is so powerful a feeling, its a state of being. A person always has within him to very different personalities. That's you without love and you while in love. In love, I'm full of goals, ideas, glass half full, my bank account may be low, but it doesn't effect me. I can deal with anything while in love. I'm more confident while in love.

I spend my days now trying to stay above water, to not drown in the depression. But no matter how well I swim that day, the pull is still my depressive state. Everyday it's like I'm staring into a black abyss that probably goes down infinitely. It's hypnotic and my main goal for the day is to pretend that this gaping exist actually doesn't exist within me.

"Post: I might be feeling this way, because I demand too much from myself. I made a similar post about how it could be a sleep problem, but I have a lot of thoughts in my head, so let me share this, and comment if you think you relate. Basically, I don't want to settle for what my life is right now. I don't want to accept a cheap, easy job. I don't want to accept my poor mental health, and I don't want to take any of the medicine I'm given. I don't want to live with my parents. I think my mom's not smart, and my step-dad has always been an angry alcoholic. I remember the feeling that he hated me ever since my childhood, but then I think he has trouble understanding people. I don't want to be any of the things I hate, and I became very hateful ever since that feeling and the mind fog started. I don't know. I felt like I'd type more, but it all revolves around money and things I hate about myself and other people. I just hate the life I have. I feel like I'm in a terrible mindset. It's a mindset that doesn't let me grow, but makes me think I should try as hard as I can to. I also feel insufferably tired lately, hence the sleep issues post on /r/getting_over_it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Crashing In Sorry this is long. I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4. I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery. I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close. She became a reason to live. Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot. Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true. So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help. They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide. Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning. Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce. The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days. In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter. I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed. I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low. Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story. I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD. I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really. I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone. Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a profound sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair. The poster describes a long history of depression, substance abuse, failed relationships, and struggles with their daughter's allegations of abuse. The mention of suicidal thoughts, a lack of support from loved ones, and a belief that medication and therapy are not working indicates a severe level of emotional distress. The overall tone of the post is desperate and expresses a deep longing for help, hope, and connection. These symptoms align with those commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: If people treated broken arms like they treated depression... Person: ""He dude, your arm is broken in half. You should probably call for help"".

"Post: I thought things were getting better... Sorry for the little rant... I just needed to say this somewhere. After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all. TL:DR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several key indicators of very severe depression. The poster recounts a recent suicidal attempt, indicating extremely high levels of emotional distress. They express a short-lived period of hope and optimism followed by a return to thoughts of self-harm and regret.

The poster also mentions difficulties with functioning academically and financial worries, further adding to their emotional distress and sense of hopelessness. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of despair, guilt, and overwhelming emotional pain that suggests a significant level of depression."

"Post: My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text] One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides. Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him. Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: ""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%! I probably won't pay you the money."" I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on. I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money. He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend.

"Post: Being told by my brother making friends isn’t that hard for someone my age bothers me every time I think about it It’s pretty damn hard when I have no hobbies to relate to anyone except stay in my room on my computer because I’d rather just be away from everyone so I don’t make it hard on them. And being told to go to clubs by my parents. I just feel more of a disappointment when I tell them there’s nothing I’m interested in and that I also am too afraid to still be alone when I join one. I’ve done everything I could in my life to try to fit in or make new friends, and there’s a reason why I have no motivation to try any of these anymore. And then they say it wouldn’t hurt trying. That couldn’t be any further from the truth. If I try to fit in again and still don’t have anyone to talk to, I’m gonna hate my life even more. It’s like I’m trapped. I can’t do anything to please me. One day I want friends, then the next I don’t want anybody at my school to bother me because I know they don’t really want me to be there friend.

"Post: Friend problems So my school is a small school so in my class there’s only 10-12 people. I currently have a friends let’s call them Monica and natalie. I hang out with them but, I’m always the second one. By second one, I mean like a second choice. When one of them isn’t at school or aren’t with them, they’ll come to me. It’s a problem when I have to get a pair for class activities like in PE. I had a friend who I thought she could be my real friend. I’ll call her hailey. I one told her a secret and she spoiled it to the whole school. I still gave her a chance. She started being really harsh on me and what I like which is photography. She would always insult me and say negative things that makes me think negative. I realized that we didn’t really go well and that our interests are very different. So We kinda stopped hanging out often. I tried my best to be funny and social. My friendship between my friends (Natalie and Monica) were getting better but I was still the one that they didn’t really care. Now hailey is trying so hard to be friends with Monica, Natalie and maybe me. Natalie knows that she’s trying to “be like us” but Monica doesn’t. Monica is slowly hanging out with hailey. Hailey started to ask me what I like to wear and all the small stuff. And she also wouldn’t stop talking about my crush and his best friend. Which is uncomfortable for me. her personality changed and I realized she is actually trying to be like my friends. I currently don’t know who should I be friend with since I don’t have a best friend. It’s quite embarrassing when I have to get a pair because I have no one. I don’t know what to do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me. Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this. Context: I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal. In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure. Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this. However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone. I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted. Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made. In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you. Your wealth isn't just something you have, it's seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you're just lazy. The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a ""high value job"", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those ""high value jobs"", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: My best friend’s husband shot himself friday night. I’m angry. He was a manly man. All of us. All of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world, in a house, that thought mental health professionals were quacks. He thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak. This was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented. So I’m mad. At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it’s weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste. I’m guilty for not trying to do more. I’m heartbroken that I’ll never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful. I’m confused by the events leading up to it. I just need help. I don’t know what to do. I’m spending most of my time with my best friend and trying to be strong and give comfort where I can.

Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me. For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we've been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i haven't talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem.

"Post: I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning] My trauma happened when i was 8, I'm now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I've only really been dealing with it for 6 years now. I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I'm still struggling with constantly. I haven't gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I've been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile. I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Don't know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I'm so afraid of waking up when I'm 40 and still feeling the same way I do now. The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I can’t afford college because I didn’t do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I didn’t have any real thought-out “grand plans” because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through. It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I'm suffering so much still. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I really just want to die."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Am I Depressed? While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner. Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right? I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.) I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners. I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable. I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Me [28F] and my husband [29M] don't want children. His parents disagree with our decision so much that they want him to divorce me. For the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive. Recently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes. However, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions. My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision. At the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward. --- **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do?

"Post: Work I like to stay at work for long hours because it seems to be the only place where someone is glad to see me. I get to help my team members and we all laugh with each other. I almost hate to go home to someone reminding me of what I haven't done yet. At the same time, my coworkers don't really see me as a friend. I'm constantly on the outside of the conversations taking place. I'm often left behind during break and if a coworker shows or shares something with the other while I'm there,I will be ignored.

"Post: I hate my boring, routine life. I’m accomplishing nothing, I’m not living. I’m simply existing. I am so sick of getting up and working 9-5 five days a week. My job stresses me out so much that I can’t unwind and relax in the few hours I have to myself a day, my weekends are full of errands that I can’t do during the week because of working, I have no hobbies and I have no energy in any free time I have to start some. I don’t make enough money to really have any experiences, I’m so bored. I can’t take time off work even though I have PTO because the amount of work I have to catch up on even missing one day is unreal and it stresses me out more to miss work than it does to be there. I am so sick of this cyclical life. I hate being told I have to spend 1/3 of my life at a job. How does anyone get over this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Den my uncle sent his kids to outside cities too , but all faild wid single digits.

Bt he sent police, to arrest dem. D police laughd n went away, saying ""u beat them and den u cmplained?""....from then on der wer court cases n cases. so that was what happened. Problem now is he moved away and now his land is bought by another relative but he still comes and make a scene. plus he poisoned his kids like "" you arent allowed to say his name (dads) in house"". its like he is using that incident (land dispute n court cases) to dissipate all his jealousy and ego on my dad. coz there many ppl involved but he is just on my dad. i mean yeah you adults hv issues okay.. but dont spoil the next generation. i know this is getting too long n no specific questions is asked ..imma answer in comments if i get any reply lol. i just wanna get sm views and how would you handle this...plus advice because i dont wanna spoil the relationships between my cousins n us because of whatever is going on with the adults."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: How to help my mom make friends? My parents have had a rocky relationship since I've known them, some times worse than others. Over the years, my father's caustic conversationalism and other factors has caused my mom's friendships to fade away. She's been quite depressed in the past couple of years, although in a slightly better frame of mind lately. They're in their 50s and recently had to move 2 hours away from their longtime home for my dad's work, and my mom is rather isolated. How can I help her make friends? They live in the country and can't really even get internet at their house right now. My dad has mellowed slightly with age, and is *generally* well-intentioned but clueless as to how this affects her and what she needs. Any tips would be great."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post shows concern and empathy for the poster's mother who is experiencing social isolation and depression. However, the post itself does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression in the poster. The language used is more focused on seeking advice for how to help their mother make friends and improve her social situation. There is not a prevalent sense of hopelessness or despair in the post, which are commonly associated with depression. The tone is more practical and seeking solutions rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
Post: I started doing my homework normally I never did my homework (high school) and I started doing it second semester just because. I never had the motivation so i guess i’m getting something done.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post mentions a notable change in behavior, specifically starting to do homework which the poster previously did not do. This change in behavior can be seen as a positive sign, but the mention of lacking motivation suggests a potential underlying issue. The use of phrases like ""just because"" and ""never had the motivation"" hint at a possible lack of interest or enjoyment in activities, which can be indicative of depression. While the post does not provide extensive emotional indicators, the mention of a persistent lack of motivation raises some concern."
"Post: Why do I pick the worst friends? This is an absolute rant: I am frustrated and I don't have any friends apparently to work through this with so Reddit it is! What do you know? There I'd convieniantly a sub-reddit for this very issue I am having. First of all, I want to start off by saying, all of my friends are not terrible. The majority of them, yes. I feel like friends are supposed to add value and positive energy to your life and that is not happening in mine. It has been becoming clear over the last few months and I think I need to figure out how to dump these friends that drain me. Here are some examples. I will use letters instead of their names. Friend A. I have known A for about 10 years now. We worked together for many years. We partied together for many years. We have kept in contact for many years. I didn't see A as much when I moved about a half hour away. Life happens. Things happen. People get busy and I totally understand that. I drive, she STILL doesn't. We still remained friends though. However..... I am the one who checks up on her and messages to simply see how things are or invite her somewhere. She gets a hold of me when she needs a ride or something. I can't remember a time she has ever just called or texted to say hi and ask me how life is. I like A because she is pretty easy to talk to. We have had a lot of good times and have made a ton of memories. One thing that I always tried to look past is her utter lack of manners. I don't think in my ten years of knowing her I have ever heard her mutter a thank you. All of the things I have done for her, never once was there a thank you. I have given her tons and tons of rides and she has offered gas money and I never received a dime. I never expected a dime but if you are going to offer it at least honor your word. What really prompted this post was something that happened today. A is pregnant and she is due sometime in January. I hadn't heard from any of our mutual friends about planning a shower so I messaged her best friend and asked If she had thought about doing so. Her best friend hadn't even given it any thought. .... she said if I would like to take the reigns and plan it then she would help but had no interest in planning the party. I thought it was a little odd but I felt like A really should have a baby shower. I reached out to a few more people who I thought might have the same idea and they hadn't thought to do it either. I'll be honest, I am not a party planner. .. not even close. The thought of entertaining/interacting/etc with people makes me super anxious.... BUT all that aside... she is my friend and she deserves to be thrown a baby shower. I have been thinking about ideas over the past few weeks but haven't put anything into motion yet. I get a message from her today over Facebook that says: ""So H informed me you guy were gonna plan a babyshower for me...well we was unaware so C and R are getting together to do one...so if you would like get in touch with one of them and details can be worked out....we just know we are having it October 14th"" I read it. My first initial reaction was annoyance. Since then it has progressed... I think I would have been less annoyed if there was a ""but thank you for thinking of me anyways"" or something along those lines. There is not one ounce of gratitude in this message. I'm kind of annoyed with myself for expecting there to be any at all. One would think I would have learned by now. So, I guess the point of this rant is for me to figure out what I need to do about all of this. My gut is telling me it's time to ditch the ungrateful, mannerless nonsense. The other part is sad to lose a ""friend"". Are my expectations too high? Is it wrong of me to expect my friends to have basic manners? Please, any and all advice is welcomed."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the post suggests that the poster may suffer from depression. The post expresses frustration, a lack of friends, and a feeling of being drained by them. The poster describes their friends as not adding value and positive energy to their life, which can contribute to feelings of emptiness and isolation. The mention of feeling sad to lose a ""friend"" indicates a sense of loss and longing for meaningful connections. The poster raises questions about their own expectations and whether it is wrong to expect basic manners from friends, suggesting a possible decline in self-esteem and self-worth. Overall, the post demonstrates emotional distress and negative thoughts commonly associated with depression."
"Post: My dad says I'm careless but does nothing himself Basically my dad came into my room tonight saying that my mom over heard me and my brothers conversation. (we were talking about how hypocritical he is) He started to get really mad and started yelling at me because I never do anything the right way or enough. I usually go out to eat so Im like never in the kitchen, when he comes I to my room and starts screaming at me because I don't help around the kitchen I'm to scared to tell him that neither does he.... For example he had left his hot dog mess, rice mess, and his dishes in the living room all for us to clean up. Generally my mom would pick up after him and clean up but she is recovering from an injury that was quite serious. So when he comes into my room and yells at me, exaggerating the problem emmensly, for not helping out, I just want to scream in his face that he doesn't do anything and I'm always picking up after him... Continuing to tell me how careless and irresponsible I am. I get that I'm not perfect and I do forget some stuff but it just seems like I baby him and I get yelled at if I don't clean up after him.... Someone help me, how can I tell him that he's needs to clean up after himself!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a significant level of emotional distress and frustration. The poster describes feeling unfairly criticized and yelled at by their father, which can contribute to feelings of low self-worth and self-esteem issues commonly associated with depression. The mention of wanting to scream in their father's face and seeking help on how to address the situation suggests a high level of emotional distress and a desire to find a solution. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Why would people keep telling me “you’re a good person”, I don’t feel like I’m a good person. Yesterday my best friend sent me a text telling me “you’re a good person, you’ll find someone.” All I could think was no I don’t want to find just someone, I wanna be with someone who resembles the guy I can’t forget. Not anybody will do and if I’m such a good person he would have stayed friends with me. My mother said everyone I’m close with or knows me well including my aunt, relatives all of them wants me to take care of someone either their own daughter meaning my aunts and then other cases my elder sister because they could see I have a good heart but then she ended the conversation with when you have a lover/boyfriend you’ll forget about me, about us. Which judging by past experiences her words has some truth in it. In my mind all of this is some kind of a cosmic joke because I don’t think I would find someone like him who’d be interested in me. This leads to nowhere, I feel so sick and tired of it all already their expectations and my lack of motivation to improve myself and poor sense of self-worth."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of self-doubt, low self-esteem, and lack of self-worth. The poster questions why people see them as a good person when they do not feel that way themselves. They also express a strong attachment to someone they cannot forget and a desire to be with someone similar. They mention the expectations others have for them to take care of someone and their own lack of motivation to improve themselves. These thoughts and emotions are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness, and a lack of motivation. The overall tone of the post suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a negative outlook on their own worth and potential for finding happiness."
"Post: Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i was a baby. I've been struggling with this sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the 19th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I've always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce. After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i've been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb. She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather didn't die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard. All this just made me realize that people don't kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who haven't struggled with this can't even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill. My mother also gave me the best advice i've ever recieved. She told me that I wasn't on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it didn't matter if i didn't find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy, the same way she was for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough. Thanks for listening guys"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a profound sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair. The poster discusses their own suicide attempt and the revelation that their mother also struggled with depression and attempted suicide.

Despite seeking therapy and receiving advice from their mother, the poster still expresses a lingering sense of hopelessness and a profound understanding of the toll that depression takes on individuals. The overall tone of the post is filled with deep emotional distress, highlighting the significant level of depression the poster is experiencing."
"Post: Conservative republican parents &amp; liberal arts educated democrat child...what could go wrong? I grew up in a poor household, but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college. After graduating from school and coming back home, I realized that I have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore. They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point. And moving out is the obvious solution, but I don't just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like, I don't pay rent."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of frustration, anger, and a feeling of being misunderstood. The poster describes a significant disconnect between their beliefs and values and those of their parents, leading to constant arguments and a sense of slowly losing their mind. The mention of feeling invalidated by their parents, as well as the inability to have a conversation without it blowing up, indicate a high level of emotional distress. The overall tone suggests a significant level of emotional turmoil and difficulty in coping with the situation, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Anyone else read books as a form of escapism? I know for some people depression can be so crippling that you can’t even find the motivation to pick up a book let alone focus long enough to read it. That used to be me although I’ve always been interested in reading and loved it until my depression became that crippling. But since getting put on adderall for my ADD, I’m able to get back into reading books. Mostly fantasy books It helps me literally be in another world for a while and forget about my problems for a while and feel like I’m living another life for a while. It’s not a cure obviously for depression but it does seem to help me a little temporarily. Anyone else have a reading habit or have found reading to be helpful in this way ?? And if so, what do you like to read ?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has experienced depression that was so debilitating that it impacted their ability to read and find motivation. This suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The mention of being prescribed Adderall for ADD indicates that the individual has received professional help for their mental health, which suggests a level of severity that may align with depression. The poster describes using reading as a form of escapism and mentions that it helps them temporarily forget about their problems and feel like they are living another life. This indicates that reading serves as a coping mechanism for the poster and provides some relief from their depression. The overall tone of the post is hopeful, as they mention experiencing some level of temporary help from reading. While the post does not exhibit the extreme hopelessness or despair commonly associated with very severe depression, it does suggest a significant impact on the poster's mental well-being."
Post: Opening up to people is a waste of time. Fuck this shit. I'm never opening up or talking about my feeling ever again. I'll just let them die with me. No one understands. No one cares. Everyone critisises you. I'll let them stay inside me and fucking go crazy. I'll never ever tell anyone what I'm feeling and my problems ever again.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and frustration. The poster expresses a strong belief that opening up to others is futile and not worth their time.

The mention of wanting to keep their feelings and problems inside and allowing them to drive them crazy suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a lack of trust in others, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Sister wants to live in Costa Rica So I have some questions about this, my sister has a 2 year old and is getting no child support. She wants to sell her stuff and drive to Costa Rica to live there. If she tries this can we intervene in the interest of the child's safety/life to prevent it from happening? The scum bag dad has thus far evaded the child support services and offered to pay for the child's passport in exchange for no child support. What can we even do here?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not indicate clear signs of depression. It primarily focuses on a specific concern regarding the safety and well-being of the poster's sister's child.

While the circumstances described may be stressful, there is no significant indication of emotional pain or exhaustion typically associated with depression."
"Post: I feel as though eventually I am going to kill myself I’ve told a couple friends this. They’ve told me that I need to see my therapist more, and that I need to get back on my meds. But what if I’m content with this thought? I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy. At best I’m content. Most of the time though I’m in a shitty mood. I don’t really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that I’d commit suicide. I definitely don’t give a fuck when people get worried when I say that I’m gonna do it eventually. It is what is. I’m not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that I’ll never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking can’t but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ain’t gonna get any better With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what I’ve just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me. I’m terrified that I’m starting to give less of a fuck. Also, while I don’t think I’ll ever truly be happy, I still have hope that I will be one day. But it’s not looking good"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a profound sense of hopelessness, despair, and thoughts of suicide. The poster states that they have communicated their feelings to friends and have been advised to seek therapy and medication, but they question whether they are content with the idea of suicide. They describe their general lack of happiness, being in a negative mood most of the time, and not caring about the impact their potential suicide may have on others. The post also acknowledges the contradiction of feeling scared by their thoughts and the fear of giving less importance to them. While they hold onto a slight hope for future happiness, they admit that it is not looking promising.

I have never done anything with a guy even though there have been so many opportunities presented to me, but I always say no. I want a boyfriend, I want to have sex.

Overall, the post reflects emotional distress and a potential lack of fulfillment, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: School is making me so stressed It’s all the time. I fell asleep last night feeling okay about stuff but woke up anxious and depressed not wanting to go to my classes. I have been failing 2 of my most important classes and I just have no reason to keep going to them. It’s finals week and I’ve been stressed about finals since school started.

"Post: I feel like I’m spiraling downwards. I’m losing people and can’t do anything about it or do the wrong things. I’m just searching desperately for someone to care before it’s too late. This summer has just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times it’s not as much as I’d like. My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friends I’ve known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere. When they are gone, I’m going to be all by myself. I’ve been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse. This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. It’s like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and I’m always left on read or stood up on plans. The other night, I got drunk and did something I’ve never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still don’t know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far. I don’t know. I just feel like this year has just been me slowly losing the only things that make me happy."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Post: Even in objectively good circumstances I feel this emptiness Do you also feel this empty hole inside you while doing objectively interesting things like being on a holiday or doing something with your friends. This lack of feeling is it's own kind of devastating in my opinion since you can not blame your bad surroundings for your feelings thereby losing hope and any motivation for improving your live since you will only continue having this numb feeling you always have anyway.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post uses phrases such as ""empty hole"", ""lack of feeling"", and ""numb feeling"" to describe a sense of emotional emptiness.

"Post: My friend is a douchebag I don’t know what to do about my friend. I guess you could say he is the “leader” of our friend group. Because of this, no one does anything when he pulls a dick move. Everyone seems to worship him. He never thinks anything is his fault, even when he can do the most fucked up thing. He has no respect for anyone, he’s extremely rude. I can’t trust the guy cause he’ll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. He’s a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I don’t know what to do. He says I’m his best friend, and it seems like that when it’s only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said he’s a hypocrite). He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but he’s friends with all of my other friends. I can’t even seem to get him out of my life if I even try (our parents are pretty good friends). I just don’t have no idea what to do. Any advice would be greatly apprecited. By the way I’m in high school."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster suffers from depression. While the poster expresses frustration, anger, and feelings of being mistreated by their friend, these emotions are primarily focused on the specific situation and relationship dynamic. There is no mention of any overarching feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or lack of interest in activities. Additionally, the tone of the post is more seeking advice and looking for solutions rather than expressing a deep emotional distress commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Why does seeing other people happy just depress me more? It just seems that when I see other people at school in the hallways or in class with their friend, they're always happy.

Reasoning: The post expresses a feeling of sadness and depression when seeing others happy. The poster mentions feeling depressed by the sight of other people's happiness and questions whether they should be happy for them.

"Post: Do you ever feel like why bother we’re all going to die anyhow and all we’ve accomplished and done will be forgotten? I enjoy art, but I often think why bother. I’ll die one day and all my art work will be thrown away. There’s a lot I do enjoy but none of it serves any purpose. After you go on vacation for example you’re just left with the memories, until you get old and forget it all. Sure it was fun at the moment but serves no long term purpose and one day even the memories will be gone. They say enjoy life but why? Animals don’t. They just do what they do. They’re only purpose is to keep their species alive and technically that’s our only purpose in life to keep our species going. Maybe if we didn’t spend so much time focusing on life and enjoying it we’d actually be happier people and more accepting of pending doom. I don’t know, that’s just how I feel most of the time. Why I even bother to write this or anything else on Reddit I don’t know."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of hopelessness and existential questioning, indicating a potential connection to depression. The poster questions the purpose and value of life and activities, and expresses a lack of motivation or fulfillment from artistic pursuits. The mention of memories being forgotten and the comparison to animals not needing to enjoy life suggest a lack of joy or fulfillment in the present moment. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of despair and a lack of hope, further supporting the possibility of depression."
"Post: Hey reddit, give me one moment. Take a deep breath. Release yourself of your roles and see yourself as a person dealing with other people. Take a moment right now, take a deep breath and appreciate how there is so much effort taken in making the world as it is. We harnessed the elements and made the surface of the world a little more enjoyable. Sit back and enjoy all this hard work. Strip the world off from labels. People do not mean to be good or bad. Remember that after you acomplish (or not) all your goals we are still people living with other people. Remember today. Take another deep breath, if you are comfortable, close your eyes. Appreciate whats around you, good or bad. Maybe the day is really ugly. Remember again that it is on around its own business. Do not see it about yourself, but instead look at your role in the big picture. Have a smile. You deserve it ;)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains a mix of positive and reflective statements, but there are also indicators of emotional distress and an underlying feeling of emptiness.

"Post: Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of depression.

The mention of being tested for ADHD and awaiting results further emphasizes the potential underlying mental health concerns. The poster also shares their deep-seated reservations about taking antidepressants, indicating a level of fear and uncertainty surrounding medication. The overall tone of the post conveys a significant level of emotional distress and a desire for guidance and support, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend? I’m in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we’ve been dating since. It’s faded for me at least, and I don’t feel the same way I did at all, but from what she’s told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we’ve already hit the “I love you” stage. I still care for her as a person and there’s nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it’s just not what it was and I feel like I’ve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she’s both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this. I know it’s a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can. I haven’t done anything like cheat on her or hurt her emotionally but I know this will crush her either way..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reveals that the poster is in a difficult position of wanting to break up with their depressed and suicidal girlfriend. They express that their feelings for her have faded, but also express concern for her mental health and well-being.

The poster acknowledges that breaking up will likely have a significant impact on her, which suggests they understand the severity of her mental health issues. Overall, the post showcases a combination of personal struggle, empathy, and a sense of responsibility towards their girlfriend's well-being, which aligns with the emotional challenges that can be associated with depression."
Post: I'm killing myself for a job that would replace me within a week if i dropped dead. Take care of yourself.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

The statement ""I'm killing myself for a job"" suggests a high level of emotional strain and the feeling of being trapped in a situation that is not fulfilling or valued.

"Post: I don't want to exist anymore My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she doesn't love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object. I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life. Every day I feel like I'm bothering other people and I'm not doing anything good, and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend. I don't want to commit suicide, but often I find myself thinking how better it would be if I stopped existing..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of intense emotional pain and despair. The poster describes the breakup with their girlfriend, feeling used and discarded, and experiencing a lack of trust and connection with others. They express a sense of worthlessness and feeling like a burden to others.

The overall tone of hopelessness, self-loathing, and disconnection aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I'm just so fucking lonely and I'm tired of pretending I'm fine Fair warning I'm about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post I'm so tired of being alone I can't bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I'm a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I'm not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I'm never seen. I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I couldn't tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They've either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it's time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I ""have"" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open. I'm also desperately single. I haven't been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it's soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I'm so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we're pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I'm tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone. But most of all, I'm tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers won't think I'm weird. Just so my mom won't go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I'll be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl. All in all I'm tired of pretending I'm happy, that I'm fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I'm not happy, I'm slowly dying over here and I can't take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a ""normal"" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by. I guess my rant is over.

"Post: In law family vacation + newborn My husband and I have been married since August 2016. I am now pregnant due in April. We have been going on vacation with his parents for the last 3 yrs with his 2 sisters and last year their husband's too. They assume that we will be going on vacation this year too, the baby would be 4 months old I DONT WANT TO GO. FYI, his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me. Reasons I don't want to go 1. We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that. 2. It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at. 3. My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby. Everyone else doesn't see this, or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive. 4. I don't even know why I've gone the last 3 years as by the 3rd day I am drained. I am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something I don't have to My question is how do I tell them we are not going (my husband is backing me 100%) specially cause I know my MIL will resist Do you guys think it's ok that I don't want to go"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

Post: I think my friends ditched me. I was recently doing a mass unfollowing on Instagram and I noticed a lot of people that I went to high school and college with are no longer following me. Same thing with Facebook. I don’t blame them because I’m boring and they are either married with kids or they’re just out to the hottest bar or club every damn weekend. I don’t drink nor am I in a relationship or married. Where does a 29 year old go to make new friends and even find the love of their life? I failed to find her in school or work. Am I just doomed to roam the planet a loner who only can have internet friends. Sure it’s cool at first but I need real friends to talk to and someone to marry for real.

"Post: Today, I found out that my depression is treatment resistant I've been on 8 different antidepressants and the such. Prozac, Paxil, wellbutrin, pristiq, viibryd, seroquel, abilify, and trintellix. It feels like the past year and a half or so has been nothing but pills. I've been depressed since I was around 9 or 10, and now I know I'll probably be depressed for the rest of my life. I'm about to start tms therapy. Has anyone here tried it? I don't want to get too optimistic after the utter failure that was the pills, but I would really like some encouragement so that I don't feel like I'm throwing my money away. It's covered by my insurance, but the co-pays do add up for the whole procedure."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of despair, hopelessness, and frustration. The poster expresses a history of trying multiple antidepressants without success, indicating a treatment-resistant form of depression.

"Post: My friend wants to use my house, so she can be alone with her boyfriend. Should i let her? So, my friend's got a boyfriend. They're in the ""lovey dovey"" phase right now, and they really want to consummate their relationship, i think they should wait until they're 18, but it's their choice to make. Anyway, my conflict is this. They want to have sex, but they have nowhere to do it at. They're too poor for a hotel, and both their parents watch them like hawks whenever they're together. Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn't have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an ""open door"" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house. The only time her parents aren't watching her is when she's with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends. On the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she's gone until almost 6 in the morning. My father is sometimes their on the weekend, but he's often away, for months at a time (he's a trucker), he's gone right now actually. (THey let her stay with me so i can have company at home, when my parents are gone) So, i'll be alone this weekend. Earlier today, her boyfriend came up to me and asked if they could ""do the deed"" in my house this weekend while my parents are out, he knows of my situation as well. They both want this, they practically begged me. I told them i would think about it. So, should i allow this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression.

"Post: Weekends are the worst There's nothing to distract myself on the weekends. I did spend time with friends Friday and Saturday, but the majority of the time I just sit at home and watch youtube or do some other dumb shit. I've been trying to quit drinking and smoking weed, but they really numbed the weekend away to make it bearable. Now I'm just a sad sap with nothing to do. I am trying to take up hobbies to fill the time but it seems pointless. The worst part is that I have had some really good days this week and I thought that maybe I was better. The depression is worse after I've felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. I've been overwhelmed with cravings for alcohol all weekend and I've been trying to get some homework done, but all I can focus on is wanting to drink. Maybe I should just get drunk to make them go away for a while."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I'd share my thoughts from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I'd share some of my own thoughts. I don't want a job. The hardest part of having a job is talking. It's bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking. Meeting new people is also tough. It's even tougher when you're the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it? Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it’s annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained. There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience. I'm thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself. I'm tired of working in restaurants. I'm tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I'm tired of repeating phrases I'm told to repeat. I'm tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people’s shitty food is prepared. I'm tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless. Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame. I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job. I really don't want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I'm all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable. Because it is more valuable."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong sense of discomfort and dissatisfaction with work and social interactions. The poster describes finding it difficult to talk and make eye contact, feeling drained and annoyed by customers, and expressing a desire for better and more meaningful work. The tone of the post is negative and displays a lack of fulfillment and motivation. These emotions and attitudes align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as lack of interest or pleasure in activities, low energy levels, and negative thoughts and feelings about oneself and one's circumstances."
"Post: In the mood to vent So I'm gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I wasn't stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it's possible I'm autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I didn't really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wasn't very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I'm probably gonna drop out of HS soon.

"Post: My little brother was in pain and I didn't help him I need to get something off my chest that I haven't talked to anyone about before. It's about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother's bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren't pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn't need it anymore now that he's not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services. He stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother ""I don't want to go to the welfare home"" (that's what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up. It is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he's a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there's no sadness left in him."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes.

I’m 21, only had one job that lasted 3 months. I’m graduating and leaving college behind soon. I know I won’t be able to make it in the working world like everyone else.

"Post: Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i'm entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a ""friend"" tells me i'm dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I'll never get a girlfriend, i'll never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called ""Pussy"" ""Weak"" ""Retarded"" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I don't know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They're all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wasn't lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it doesn't matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doesn't matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they're doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving aren't they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I won't get any benefit from it either way. A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I don't know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now. I constantly wear this mask where i pretend i'm happy, when i'm not. The only thing I do with my life is listen to Joy of Mans Desiring in bed, contemplating my existence."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Losing my brother My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what I’d heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone. My family members are taking it in their own ways.

"Post: Am I going insane or is this normal? Zoning out I was always praised for my memory. Didn't ever revise for exams but I'd still get good grades. Nowadays not so much. I'm constantly 'zoning out'. It's got to the point where I sometimes forget what happened 30 seconds ago. I'll be in shower and zone out for 30 seconds, come back and I can't remember if I washed my hair or not. It's always simple things like that. I still have no problem with studies, remembering appointments and generally anything that matters. Yet, I still check if I closed the fridge door 3 times within a few minutes...

"Post: Will my best friend come back because of this reason?

"Post: What can I do in this situation? After graduating high school last summer, I stopped hanging out with all my friends. Some just stopped contacting me since they now live far away living in dorms and such..and others I dropped because they were fake. Sometimes I do sort of regret it, but that's only because of the loneliness and boredom I feel home alone on a weeknight. I'm currently taking a year off and I only have one close friend. I've only known this friend for a year but we got along so well. We had soo many things in common. But now I feel like he's super fake. For ex, he talks crap about his ""friends"" but then posts photos and acts all nice and friendly around them. When he talks about them with me, it genuinely sounds like he hates them and says he never wants to hangout with them..but then does??. Not only that, but nowadays whenever we hang all he seems to do is complain and judge other people. Like, at first it use to be ok..but now it's all the time. It's so toxic and just a cheap form of communication imo. He's also always late whenever we schedule a meetup. Not once was he ever on time, sometimes he makes me wait an hour because he took his time to get ready when he knows that I'm waiting for him. We also never get to do what I want to do anymore because he's ""lazy"". For ex, I really wanted to go to this cute cafe and he also did too..but then on the day of he was taking so long to get ready we ended up not having time to go. We only get to do what I want if he's benefitting from it. Just thinking about this makes me wanna go to him right now and let out all my anger at his face. I do confront him, but it's almost as if he forgets. I would tell him that I hate it when he makes fun of my body or rubs whatevers on his hands on my shirt as if it's a tissue but then a couple weeks later he'll do it. ugh. Just recently too..he was telling me about his cousin and how she literally talks crap about everyone which led to me asking if she ever talked about me. He said yes and she basically called me weird just because of my face shape. I know it's nothing serious but it made me mad because I'm super self conscious about it. But what made me even more mad was the fact that my so called ""friend"" didn't even stick up for me. He didn't tell her to stop or anything. Sorry that this turned into a rant, but I really wanted some advice. I feel so lonely. When he hangout I feel as I have to be this super fun person because he seems to talk about how his other friends are so fun when he hangs out with me. It wasn't always like this..maybe we're growing apart from each other, I don't know, but I'm purposely taking a break from him for two weeks..we scheduled a meetup for his bday but idk how that'll go. Any advice or opinions are welcome. I just want to hear what others think about my situation. Thanks."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason. I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me. I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up. So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual. I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things. I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life. I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work. It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me. On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me. I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise. I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle. I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult. I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel. I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept. I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself. I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode.

Things have smoothed over but I still want to go to court so this arguing over days will stop but I do not want to fuck myself over due to not having a job . I live with my mom and have a stable household but having him 5 days out of the week it’d be hard for me to get a job that will work with me .

"Post: Anyone else stay up all night on their phone in bed because it feels like no time is being lost?

"Post: Too cowardice or just selfish? So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now. There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch. So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one. So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend. (you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry) The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up).

"Post: Music to uplift? Okay, Reddit, I'm having a really rough 6 months. I keep thinking the fog will lift any day now but it just sits there blurring the line between myself and the things I once enjoyed. Maybe some music would help.

The doctor would probably run me through a variety of medications that could have bad side effects.

I just want to make people happy. I’ve always been pretty good at telling jokes, which is weird since I’m super introverted and if I’m not joking I’m super quiet.

"Post: Asian parents, jealousy, what to do? Hello I am an asian american son trying to help out my family. My family from Vietnam moved here 5 months ago and have been living together with my Mom and Dad. I no longer live at home, and couldn't live at home if I wanted to because of the space and my relatives here for the first time to America, which is fine with me. I recently found out about drama going on at home, it involves my mom and dad and my female cousin. About one ago before my relatives moved here from vietnam, something had happen to my great aunt , she had given advice to my mom about being careful about her husband and any woman in the house. What had happen to my great aunt was, she caught her husband trying to cheat with her niece. I'm not sure if they actually had an affair or whatnot, but just warning her to be careful about this type of situation in the house. I really feel like it was unfair for my great aunt to put these thoughts in my mom's head because why do that? Especially when they are about to come and move in and start a new life in America. So back to the drama, my dad has been super stress out calling me, telling me that he is unable to handle the situation anymore. He said my mom thinks he is looking at my female cousin in a inappropriate way. She happens to be 19 years old. My dad just thinks this is crazy, he works 2 jobs (15 hours a day) trying to pay mortgage and pay all the bills. My mom doesn't work and stays home. My dad has been calling me saying he only is able to sleep 4 hours a night because every time he comes home from work, my mom is always giving him a ear full, and hes to the point where he can't take it anymore and thinking about just continuing to pay the bills and living somewhere else. I tried to talk to my mom and want to be completely open minded about the situation, she just tells me that I dont know, and she can tell the way he acts at home. Her reasoning is, she just can tell by the way he looks at her. She said she knows that he won't ever take it that far by cheating, but its her being jealous which is causing all this drama. In the house consist of my female cousin, male cousin, aunt and uncle. Also my other aunt and uncle and my mom and dad. its a pretty full house, and my parents have been arguing every other night. My aunt called me tonight trying to keep the peace in the house and calm down both sides. My female cousin and her family has no idea this is going on. But most likely suspect something because of the arguing between my parents and im afraid they will find out whats going on soon enough, which will be really embarrassing. I feel like my mom and dad need marriage counseling, or my mom needs to see a therapist, but being asian they don't believe in these types of counseling classes and will be very hard to get my mom to agree to do something like this. --- **tl;dr**: What can I do to help out my family? I'm not trying to take sides but I really don't think my dad would ever cheat on my mom. Every time I try to talk some sense Into my mom, she always ends up getting mad, and saying everyone thinks I'm crazy but I'm not. They have been married for 30 years and my dad has always worked two jobs his entire life to make sure all the bills are paid, that we have food and shelter."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Beautifully Broken I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me. But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist. Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself. At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse. By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with. Would I do it? Could I do it? Would anyone care? I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay. My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay. They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken. It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place. The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is. I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn’t that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we’re afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don’t want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics,"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again. It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can. I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that. I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself. I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried. I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life. The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him. Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do.

"Post: I think you guys might understand this. I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, ""I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time.""

She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken.

"Post: Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression. For me it's the opposite. I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper. (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11). Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average. This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person. But I think that was the beginning. I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year. It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there. My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do. My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11. The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed. I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am? By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed.

I’m a 28 year old female from Canada, living in the United States with my husband. I’m in the immigration process which is great but it also means while I’m waiting I can’t really do much. It’s tough when you don’t know many people down here when your far far away from family and friends. One can only watch so much Netflix! I came upon some very interesting sites for surrogate grandparents which would be amazing, but I feel like I’m too old. I’d love to form a family type bond with some people/a person here who also just needs someone to talk to and occupy their time. Anyone have any thoughts/ideas on this? Or maybe you know someone whose also lonely looking for a friend to talk to, any help would be greatly appreciated."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Need advice on helping a friend escape an abusive dad A week ago, my best friend Jake (not his real name) confided in me that he has been physically and emotionally abused by his father since childhood. We are both 17 years old and we have been best friends for 4 years. I was really shocked when I found out because everyone in our high school friend circle sees him as extremely seemingly cheerful and upbeat. I'm his best friend, and I never suspected anything was wrong. This morning, he texted me saying that he was running away from home. He told me he left his home with a backpack full of clothes and $100 that he had secretly saved up without his dad's knowledge. I'm very worried about him. On the one hand, I think he should get out of that dangerous situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, I think it will be very difficult for him to survive on his own with so little money. Any advice on how I could help him as a friend?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: What to do with my life. I just turned 21 in June and I’m really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I didn’t care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off. In that year off I didn’t grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and I’m anti social. I’m not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I don’t even know if I can go back to school because of my grades were and I was lucky enough to get into school. I don’t want to move out I just want to go to school and come home as quickly as I can no friends nothing. This lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point. Do I kill myself? What’s the point of living if I don’t finish school and get a job, why live if I’m just gunna work min wage my whole life? Lately I’ve been asking myself this everyday. What do I do with my life? Is there really a point in living if I don’t become a engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc ? All my friends are doing great but I’m just at the bottom and I don’t understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that isn’t even at school In my early 20s and I’m living at home. I’ve already missed out of going away for university.

"Post: Toddler learning videos on youtube. Sometimes, we take long commutes in the car with our toddler. Especially, when one parent is driving we let the little one watch videos on the iPad as to not become a distraction for the driving parent. We got one of those iPad holders for the neck support.

"Post: Having to share a small living space with Grandpa My grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament. Backstory: I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed. Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. ""I'm here with my grandson!"" There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band. Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us. Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink. Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight.

Reasoning: The post indicates a long history of depression and a significant range of symptoms, including depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, and hopelessness. The poster describes trying multiple medications and experiencing unsatisfactory results, including feeling like a ""numb zombie"" and the medication not working. This suggests a prolonged struggle with finding effective treatment for their depression. The mention of wanting to explore alternative methods and a desire to find a natural solution further indicates a high level of distress and a willingness to try different approaches. Overall, the post displays a pattern of chronic depression, failed medication attempts, and a strong desire to find relief, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Consistent problems with friends distancing themselves Really sorry in advance of how long this is! So some background on me: I’m a 23 year old female. Had a pretty typical life growing up. Had a really stereotypical family - mom, dad, sister, and me. Had good friends growing up, moved schools as a kid only once, and had stuff I was passionate about. During my sophomore year of high school though, my parents got divorced, and shortly after, I had some events happen in my life that sent me into a deep depression. I became suicidal. Now mind you, up through this point, I have had a close knit group of about 8 of us. One girl and I had been friends for almost 7 years and generally I got along with pretty much anyone. Then this guy I knew from performing arts stuff and I ended up going into a relationship. He was 4 years older than me, meaning he was in college when we started dating, I had barely turned 16 and never had been in a serious relationship, he was charming and wanted me to “not be so naive” and - if you can’t already see the warning signs - this became an extremely abusive relationship, in pretty much every way possible starting with emotional abusive, escalating to physical abuse, and eventually sexual abuse. It completely destroyed me as a person. He forced me to end friendships with anyone who tried to help get away from him, which ended up being all of my friends. Eventually, my college roommate helped me escape from him and helped me to get a restraining order during my Freshman year of college. Thankfully, I’m in a really wonderful relationship with someone incredibly kind and supportive and have been for nearly 5 years. But with the exception of my boyfriend now, I haven’t been able to connect with people like I used to before that abusive relationship. Some friends I had back then, friends I loved dearly, never forgave me for ending the friendship, despite the fact I never wanted to. And it still really hurts. I mostly have had off and on friendships through recent years. Mostly the story is: I start talking to a potential friend, we quickly find a bunch of similarities and similar humor, become close really quickly, they become avoidant/ distant/ flakey (or in a recent case - manipulative) and I get upset and end the friendship. I’m quick to forgive and a HUGE pushover, and people really take advantage of this and at some point, I realize this and that’s when I get upset. The other story is that I start to slowly build friendships, like with people at work, and I think things are going well and I come to realize they don’t really care to be anything more than work friends or they don’t like me as much as I thought they did. I currently have 2 friends that I really care about. One of them lives really far and I only get to see occasionally. The other has started to use the busy excuse with me, but then she plasters her hanging out with everyone but me on social media, but the goes on about how she misses me so much and wishes we could hang out. She literally only lives 20 minutes away and she either flakes or lies about being busy working. It’s starting to really bring me down and I feel really down about it since I feel like it’s something that ultimately ends up happening no matter how hard I try or how good of friends we are. To sum everything up, I feel like I’m at a loss and I have a hard time connecting with anyone. I feel like people go out of their way to distance themselves from me when I want to actually do ~friend stuff~ like hang out. I feel like I’m missing something."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes a history of deep depression, suicidal thoughts, and being in an abusive relationship. These traumatic events have had a lasting impact on their ability to connect with others and form friendships. They express a sense of loneliness, rejection, and feeling like people distance themselves from them. This emotional distress and difficulty in forming meaningful connections align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: How can I tell me friend that I don't want to babysit his (difficult) kid? I want to be a good friend, and there for him in case of emergencies. I've picked up his kid from daycare before when his babysitter called out on him. But then he asked me to babysit and the hours ended up being 8AM to 7PM(!). He asked me two weeks ago if I could babysit on February 3rd, and I told him I couldn't make a commitment so far in advance. (Knowing he'd have plenty of time to find a sitter). This is clearly not an emergency, and he's about to ask me again (it's a week away). I know I shouldn't have led him on at all; that it's better to be direct. But dear god, I cannot come up with the words to tell him I would rather die than spend any more time alone with his son. Last time I saw his kid, he literally threw a toy car at my face and it hit me in the mouth. He's incredibly defiant and screams bloody murder all day. He refuses to hold my hand if I take him out of the house to the park and screams and screams and I just hate that kidd!!!!!!! I know I can't tell him how much I dislike being around his kid, and I don't want to end up hinting at this. Any suggestions on a response text? I don't want to have to keep telling him I have plans. I want him to stop asking."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of emotional distress. The poster expresses a strong dislike and aversion towards spending time with their friend's difficult child, going as far as saying they would rather die than be alone with him. They describe the child as defiant, screaming all day, and physically aggressive towards them. The poster also expresses frustration and a sense of helplessness in their inability to communicate their true feelings to their friend. This post shows signs of significant emotional distress and potentially underlying issues with anger, frustration, and possibly even thoughts of self-harm, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Reddit, need your help on restoring friendship Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those ""good old friends"", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me. Thanks in advance."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does convey some sense of distress and concern about the deteriorating friendship. The poster acknowledges their mistake and expresses a desire to fix the situation, as losing their best friend would be painful. However, the post does not exhibit the intense emotional pain, exhaustion, or hopelessness typically associated with very severe depression. The primary focus is on seeking advice and finding the right words to address the situation rather than overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: How to ask someone to move out. TL:DR Friend has overstayed their welcome, how to politely ask her to leave? 4 months ago, my friend was going through a rough time. She had split up with her partner and was struggling to find somewhere to live. My fiance and I own our home and had a spare room so offered her to stay, till her work contract was up in February, for a very very low rent (it's a quarter of what people pay in our area). So now we're in february she has a renewed contract at work and isn't looking at places to live. Little things she does around the house bug me, but thats probably just because its our home and not a shared rental. However recently I've suffered a string of ill health (multiple hospital admissions) and now i'm home I just want my own space! She has cut her work hours to look for a new job but barely looks and just sits around the house. I feel like i'm cleaning up after her all the time, plus she is always eating our food. At the moment I am struggling to keep on top of my own mess let alone hers. How can I go about asking her to move out without losing the friendship?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and annoyance with the friend who has overstayed their welcome, but it does not indicate any significant emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post is mainly practical and focused on finding a solution to the living situation without damaging the friendship. While the poster may be experiencing some stress and exhaustion due to their own health issues and the additional responsibilities, it does not suggest a severe depressive state."

Why me I do everything right and I still get fucked. Ps sorry for grammar," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a deep sense of anger, betrayal, and emotional pain. The poster describes putting all their love and trust into someone who turned out to be manipulative and took advantage of their grief and vulnerability. The mention of feeling hatred towards the person and thoughts of suicide suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The overall tone of hopelessness, despair, and feeling like everything goes wrong align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. Additionally, the mention of apologizing for grammar could indicate decreased self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy."
"Post: Communicating is hard I'm turning 19 this year and I want to move out of my family's house in September. Mostly for my studies, but also because I simply want to move out. I already tried last year but they found a housing for young girls managed by nuns, so I lived here for a while, but I felt uneasy the whole time. I'm heavily depressed and I had to drop out of school this year. My parents told me to come back home so that I could recover, which I did, but they don't approve of me going anywhere else to do so. For example, I feel really good in my boyfriend's family (he doesn't live with them anymore but I'm still very close to them) and wish to spend more time there, but my parents don't like the idea of not being able to give me the kind of comfort I need and find over there, so they'd rather have me stay home. I have spent as little time as possible in my parents' house recently, using every opportunity to get away, and it is understandable they don't like it. But I have always been a solitary kid, and now with my depression it became worse. I don't connect with my parents or any of my 4 siblings, and spending time with them feels like a chore. Communicating within the family is quite rough. And whenever I do try to explain how I feel, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that I'm in the wrong. It feels like whatever I say about feeling bad within the family is deflected by stating my parents and siblings' good intents. I'm sure they do mean well, but I now doubt even my own reasons for wanting anything but staying with them. I can't identify the reason why I don't feel easy with them, because they're all trying their best to help me through those tough times. I feel like an ungrateful brat. I'm not really confrontational either. I usually obey and agree to avoid stirring conflict, but this is getting tiring. If any of you has been in a similar situation, how can you open the dialogue? How can I tell my parents I don't feel good spending much time with them? In my family, direct family should come before everything. I also don't know how to talk about moving out and have a studio instead of being placed in a student housing, especially since my big sister (25) still lives at home despite having a job. It's not a matter of money either. I come from a middle class family and the housing my parent chose for me this year is much more expensive than a studio. Any advice would be welcomed."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling heavily depressed, having dropped out of school, and struggling to connect with their family. They express a lack of ease and discomfort in their current living situation and a desire to move out. The poster also mentions feeling like an ungrateful brat and not feeling good spending time with their family. These emotions indicate a profound sense of despair, loneliness, and disconnection commonly associated with very severe depression. The post also mentions doubting their own reasons and feeling like whatever they say about feeling bad within the family is deflected. This suggests a lack of validation and understanding from their family, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and isolation.

"Post: How do you tell your kids to handle weird adults? When I was 14, my best friend's mom started accusing me of smoking. I'd been best friends with her daughter since we were in 1st grade and I was over their house all the time. But for some reason when I was 14, she started asking. And she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about 2 more years. I had always been a straight A kid, top of my class, and a ""good"" kid. I had tried one cigarette when I was 13, had HATED it, and never tried another. I wasn't around anyone who smoked, no friends, no peers, no family members (immediate or extended) smoked, so there's no chance I smelled like smoke. But friend's mom persisted, and told me that she thought that I smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway. Because obviously that couldn't have been from anyone else right? Now in hindsight, her behavior was absolutely bizarre. As a teen, I accepted it as, she's an adult, and while I questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she'd say something, it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved. I'm hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens. While nothing truly bad happened in my case, the lady was off her rocker, and I'm lucky nothing else happened. How did people with older kids do that? Like I know my parents gave me the ""if people are making you uncomfortable, talk to us"" speech but this never made me upset, I just got angry and baffled at first, but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her. In hindsight, this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a specific concern about how to handle a situation involving a weird adult and the impact it had on the poster during their teenage years. While there is mention of anger, being baffled, and the potential for a negative outcome, the overall tone of the post does not indicate a significant level of emotional distress or hopelessness commonly associated with depression. The focus is primarily on seeking advice and sharing personal experiences rather than expressing ongoing emotional pain or despair."
"Post: What’s the worst thing a friend has ever said to you? I have two stories. 1. This was a few years ago. It was near Christmas time. I had gotten my friend a $300 iPod. I was planning on giving it to her the week before Christmas. So a week prior to me giving her the present, I take her to the movies. I worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free. But I got her a few pins we sell, we got a photo at the photo booth, and we got concessions. The total was probably around $50. When I got to paying for the popcorn and candy, my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it. I jokingly said “this is her Christmas present.” My friend said that it was the cheapest present. Should have taken the iPod back after that, just to be petty. But she had been in a serious car accident that year so I reconsidered that. 2. This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how I’m lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I don’t deserve my Masters degree because I didn’t work as hard for mine since I didn’t have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but “nobody cares about you.” She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldn’t be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesn’t give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying. Sometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains multiple examples of hurtful comments made by friends, which can have a significant impact on a person's emotional well-being. The poster shares their feelings of anger, hurt, and betrayal, as well as their decision to block the friend who made these comments. These negative experiences and the resulting emotional distress align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I didn't want have to post this, but I have to get it off my chest (I don't expect to get sympathy from this, but closure) I have a cousin, who i've known for 13 years, and over time... He became more and more distant, he got friends, most of them were verbally abusing me, you would think he would defend me, but he backed up his friends, than his own blood, me growing up, I was (and still to this day) an introvert, and I never kept a close friend, because they would either stop talking to me, or they would say that they don't like me and for the 3 years that I have known his friends, they eventually got used to me, and we played online frequently, and 2 months ago, they disapproved of me getting a GTA Shark Card (in game currency) then they insult me saying I need to grow up, and mature, basically telling me how to run my life, and I tried to stand up for myself, but they still kept saying it Its my life, if I want to act silly, then I will, but the main focus is my cousin, and how he was brutally honest, you know how we hype up our friend to make them feel good about himself/herself? That's not what he did, every time we play online with one of his friends, he would agree and add insult to injury when his friend makes fun of me, in games... He would tell everyone to go after me, in CoD, he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he's the ""leader"" but the sole reason I'm making this post, was the fact that he did one of, if not, the RUDEST thing ever, here's how it went it was my sister's birthday, I was texting, and he said that he's coming to the party, and I'm pretty happy, a smile stretches around my face, I say ""OK cool, :)"" an hour passes by, and he nonchalantly says, ""welp sorry I can't come, oh well"" and I ask why? And he says I don't know, now usually, most would tell the reason why can't come, or if they don't they make up something, but he all of a sudden says, I can't come I want you keep in mind that, the last time I was in his house, was 4 years ago, and he has only came over for my birthdays or sometime in the fall, so he RARELY comes to my house, and I'm not even allowed back at his house, because of personal reasons but anyway, he couldn't come to my house, but has time to go to his friends house WHENEVER he wants... Gee? I wonder why? -_- he did what no other friend should have done, and hurt my feelings all in one fell swoop. I'm done with him, but if he asks for forgiveness, should I ignore him, accept his apology? I'm not expecting an answer but whatever...."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and hurt. The poster discusses feeling rejected and mistreated by their cousin and friends, as well as the ongoing pattern of being verbally abused. They express feeling isolated and hurt by their cousin's actions, particularly on their sister's birthday.

"Post: Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently. This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy. I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice. During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.) Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy. My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her. I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before. The only thing I look forward to in life at the"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling lost, crying, and experiencing emotional reactions they have never had before. They express a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment in life, stating that the only thing they look forward to is spending time with a friend once or twice a week. They also mention feeling hopeless, dreading the next month, and feeling like the things they care about are slipping out of their control. The post also mentions neglecting school and feeling worried about the lack of things to look forward to.

"Post: Trying to help family of friend who committed suicide, any ideas? My friend took his life almost a year ago and his family (wife and three daughters aged 10, 14 and 18) is still reeling. None of them are getting the emotional support they need. His wife doesn't regularly see her therapist, she stays out all night several times a week with her new boyfriend, the 18 year old has suicidal thoughts, the 14 year old just feels hated by mom and, along with the 10 year old, is not getting therapy. The 18 year old is getting therapy but she's hardcore into her new religious affiliation, hating mom and can't wait to leave for college I've talked to the wife several times and shared my thoughts about what's going on, she's receptive when I when I speak to her, but it's apparent after this amount of time that she has no real intention of going through with getting the kids counseling and getting into family therapy, staying home more, spending more time with the kids, less time with the husband, etc. Does anyone have any idea how I can help? If I keep telling her what she's not doing well, I'm afraid she's going to shut me out and then I won't be able to do anything. If this isn't a good sub for this kind of thing and you have an idea what might be, please let me know. Edit--I live in NYC, they are outside of Dallas, TX, so seeing them isn't much of an option.

Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of concern and distress about the well-being of the friend's family who lost a loved one to suicide. The poster describes the wife's lack of emotional support, her reckless behavior, and the struggles of the daughters, including suicidal thoughts. The mention of the wife's resistance to seeking therapy and making positive changes suggests a significant level of emotional distress within the family.

"Post: I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy. I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn. I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction. I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me. Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: What would you do? What do you do when your depressions effects you so much to the point you don't eat or you over eat, you don't sleep or you over sleep, you don't talk to anyone or pretend to want to be around people. What do you do when your depression doesn't allow you to be motivated and takes away all the enjoyment from your life that makes you happy, removing music, dancing and laughing in replace for dark rooms, teary eyes, and silence.

"Post: Do you ever go to bed planning on losing the next few days? Im about to fire up some South Park and go to sleep. I've already planned on being useless, despondent, and out-of-touch until at least Tuesday. I will be dead to the world. I will not answer your calls/texts. I will not leave my couch. I plan on hiding from everything and avoiding everyone for at least 72 hours. I'm shutting down intentionally. I'm making it a plan. Fuck you, bye."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a strong desire to withdraw from the world, avoid social interactions, and isolate themselves for an extended period of time. The use of strong language, such as ""useless,"" ""despondent,"" and ""shutting down intentionally,"" conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and despair.

"Post: I am okay, until I have to be alone with my thoughts. I enjoy the company of my friends, even though I'm very bad at talking to them. When I'm out with them or rehearsing with my band I feel okay. I almost feel depression free for the time being— I feel like everything will be okay, that I got this, that I am in control, that it doesn't matter that I have a lot of homework due in the next week cause I'll go home and get it done. I feel strong and motivated. And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it. I hate being alone because my horrible thoughts are a lot easier to hear over the silence of no one talking."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post shows a pattern of fluctuating emotions and a significant negative impact when the poster is alone with their thoughts. While they enjoy the company of friends and feel temporarily free from depression symptoms when they are with them, the post also mentions feeling very bad at talking to friends and having anxiety about being alone. There is a clear shift in emotions from feeling strong and motivated to feeling anxious and believing that others hate them. The mention of ""horrible thoughts"" that are easier to hear in silence indicates a significant level of distress and potentially negative self-perception, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: girl So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we're both socially retarded. Literally everything's been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments. I'm not exactly depressed, just don't really feel much emotion and I don't relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I've had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I've always had the feeling that I'm tolerated but not wanted whenever I'm around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit. I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she's got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I couldn't even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling emotionally numb and disconnected from others, as well as feeling tolerated but not wanted when around others. This suggests a deep sense of isolation and lack of belonging, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster also mentions a significant change in their emotional state when they started talking to this girl, feeling happier and looking forward to seeing her. However, upon discovering she has a boyfriend, the poster experiences an intense emotional reaction, crying for an extended period of time and expressing thoughts of self-harm. The mention of self-harm and questioning if they should ""neck"" themselves is an alarming sign of suicidal ideation, which is a serious symptom associated with severe depression."
"Post: New friend always drags along insufferable friend. I've recently become chummy with a guy who I get along with swimmingly. Conversation is easy and stimulating, and we've reached the point in our friendship that we can talk about some really deep and personal stuff. Even more recently, however, he has gotten in the habit of inviting along another friend, Tony, to our friend dates. I'm not such a fan of Tony. He is negative and annoying, and genuinely makes the time we spend together unpleasant. How do I tell my friend that I don't want to hang out with Tony without coming across as a dick? Is there ever a point when I am candid about the reasons why?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It focuses on a specific social issue regarding the poster's discomfort with a new friend's choice of company and seeking advice on how to address it. While there may be a hint of frustration or annoyance, it does not display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post suggests a desire for problem-solving rather than a significant emotional distress."
"Post: Getting over a girl Hello everyone, I’ve been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I’m going through right now... So I’m a 19 year old guy, I’ve never had a serious relationship with a girl before. I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. She’s the most amazing girl I’ve ever met. She’s funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started “talking” and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still hasn’t properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I couldn’t stop. I still feel so upset about it and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I can’t stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. I’m crying again."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several emotional indicators of depression.

We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my GM who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why. His response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just 1 this week. When she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it wouldnt be a good idea anymore since she doesnt want to lose her job. Exactly one week of dating and I already lost someone that i didnt want to go away just like that. Like yeah im a bit sad but not enough to cry or anything but it just like, i was so fucken happy again i started to smile, something i havent done in months and it just felt nice but now im back to my depressed state of being lonely as usual and just play games, work and goto sleep and repeat that day after day until i end it all.

"Post: I need to sell/get rid of my gun I am realizing that the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my dog loves me. My first marriage ended over 7 years ago because my wife choose someone else over me. My fiance can create her own schedule, and she chooses to go in late so that she comes home after I go to sleep. My friends are having kids and families, and I have my little dog Dixie. She's amazing. I helped rescue her after her owner passed away and I could never do that to her again. She's 11 now and loves me. I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought ""if little Dixie goes, I'll go too."" And it took hours before I realized that I don't think I'm kidding. I work only so that bills get paid. I'll never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew won't have any memories of me. I'm crying on my couch. And I don't want to talk to anyone I know personally because they will try to tell me I have reasons to be happy, or my fiance will tell me that .... I don't know. I just need to not have an easy out sitting in my closet."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys strong indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of hopelessness, despair, and a lack of fulfillment in various aspects of their life. The mention of contemplating suicide and the role their dog plays in preventing them from taking that action suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The post also mentions strained relationships, financial struggles, and a sense of isolation from others. The mention of not wanting to talk to anyone they know personally because of potential dismissive or unhelpful responses further indicates a lack of support or understanding from their social circle. The conclusion where the poster expresses a need to remove the temptation of an easy means of ending their life reinforces the severity of their depressive state."
"Post: How do I get my Best Friend back.. Last year me and one of my Best friend decided to get into a relationship.. it lasted a couple of months and she got disturbed due to some personal problems and i made a mistake of not giving her space as obviously I was worried as a boyfriend and also the best friend because she won't share what happened to her and truly it was something bad.. We both had an amazing Friendship of 6 years before that and there may not have been a single day that went by without talking to each other.. its like she became an integral part of my life.. But after she started to distance herself from the relationship I did keep bothering her which was a mistake on my part and I did apologize to her for that.. she kept blocking and unblocking me since then and I tried my best to get back our friendship as it matters to me more than a relationship as out of the few people who truly know me and are as important as the organs of my body she is one of them.. and as we know even without one organ a person feels Handicapped as I do now... Yes it might be selfish of me as I am the only one who wants the friendship to be like before.. all of my attempts have failed so far.. but its next to impossible to not think of her as she was my routine for past 6 years.. and I too tried the regular methods suggested everywhere like cutting contact, getting busy, etc but at the end of the day you always have some time for yourself and in that time her thoughts always come to my mind..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her). A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice. This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that. She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her. She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either. I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it. When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike. What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people. Sorry for the long post. Please help."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses concern about their friend's problematic behavior and their discomfort with how others view their friend, there is no significant mention of personal emotional distress or an overwhelming sense of hopelessness or despair. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking advice and understanding how to navigate the situation, rather than expressing profound emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression."
Post: My SO has panic disorder and it’s making me depressed. My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it’s not something else) The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it’s cancer or something else deadly. He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone. I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that’s nothing is wrong he’s just having bad panic attacks. He won’t believe them because then he’ll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I’m convinced he’s a hypochondriac. We can’t go about one day without him saying he doesn’t feel good. It’s hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I’m just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we’re at. I don’t know how to fully support him through this. When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I don’t know if I should let him knowing that they’re just gonna say he’s fine or tell him that it’s in his head and make him feel like I’m not taking him seriously. I feel bad for feeling this way. But it’s making me depressed. I don’t know how to go about this.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of frustration, helplessness, and emotional distress caused by the poster's significant other's panic disorder. The poster describes their partner's constant worry about their health, excessive use of online resources, and frequent trips to the ER. This has led to the poster feeling unable to fully enjoy themselves or have a normal day without the partner expressing discomfort or wanting to leave. The poster also questions how to support their partner and feels guilty for feeling depressed because of the situation. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, frustration, and a decline in overall well-being."
"Post: An Open Letter Dear you, It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time. I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations. I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back. Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned. You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself. On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had. Not even close. Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself. I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I'd care to admit. I'm emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It's been a long three years. I'm ready for it to be over. I'm sorry. Yours truly, Me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses deep remorse, guilt, and self-blame for the end of a past relationship and acknowledges negative behaviors and treatment during that time. The mention of feeling defeated, experiencing a sense of immense failure, and describing oneself as emotionally crippled and distraught suggests a profound level of emotional distress. The post also mentions a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction from trying new relationships, highlighting a pervasive sense of longing and inability to move on from the past. Overall, the tone of hopelessness, self-destructive thoughts, and desire for the emotional pain to end align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Advice To preface this, I wanna say that I feel pathetic/incompetent/exhausted. Female, 30, currently staying at a hotel because I had to leave the house I was living in because of a conflict that recently happened. I got into a verbal argument with my sister (34) that resulted into a physical altercation. She screamed ""Go kill yourself"" and then shoved me and scratched me. My father was a witness to this. I then called the cops because i felt unsafe, she got so angry and turned a bit violent. (This is the third time she's told me to go kill myself and my parents haven't told her anything). Right before the cops came she was arguing with my dad and told me to ""Shut the f*** up! The cops arrived I told one of the cops my side of the story and she told hers. She said that I attacked her and that there were scratch marks on both her arms. I told the cops how could that be when none of the nails on my right hand are very short (I swear to you I couldn't have scratched seeing since I had no nails on one hand. The nails on my right hand are VERY short because they all broke due to cleaning the kitchen cabinets etc). The cops didn't believe me. My sister also claimed that I'm ""bipolar"" which I'm not. So the cops believed my sister and took me away on a 5150. I was released 3 hours later because the case manager said I didn't have any mental health issues. The funny thing is that I told my parents that I wanted permission to use their car to leave that house because I couldn't handle the stress that came with living with her. I would eventually return the car once I moved, got myself established etc. The stress has caused me to lose 3 pounds this week alone. After returning from the behavior health services, I gathered my bag and one suitcase and left. Currently, I'm staying at a hotel. What hurts most of all is that my parents have never told my sister to stop telling me to kill myself. It's as if thy don't care. This is such a shitty experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. I'm a hotel with no car, no friends, no home. Is it bad that to think that I just wanted my parents to tell her to stop telling me to kill myself. I feel like I'm asking for a lot. What do you guys think?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional distress and vulnerability. The poster describes feeling pathetic, incompetent, and exhausted, indicating a low self-esteem and a lack of confidence in their abilities. They share details of a conflict with their sister, including verbal and physical altercations, and express feeling unsafe and unsupported by their parents.

"Post: Exercise will make you feel better! Is what everyone says. So I listened and signed up for a gym membership. Fast forward one year later, I've become *so* obsessed with the image of my body and being as thin as possible, I overexercised and underate, so on top of my depression, I messed up my health and I developed an eating disorder which is making me far more depressed.

"Post: Pornography and how it can impact Marital Satisfaction and trust Hello! I am about to graduate with a BS in family studies and I'm currently doing research on pornography use and marital satisfaction and trust within relationships. This is an important topic of study, and it would be super appreciated if you took this short 5 min survey to further my research.

The tone of the post is more informative and professional rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain or hopelessness."
"Post: Addicted to escapism If I am not occupying myself with any form of entertainment (games, books, movies, music, drawing, writing, etc.) I feel depression and anxiety.

"Post: i’m so tired i don’t know what i’m doing in life or where i’m going and i know i’m young and have “plenty of time to figure it out” but that doesn’t make life any less intimidating. after i graduated hs my parents told me to wait to go to college because we couldn’t afford it. understandable, we’ve always been poor, just barely making ends meet. that was two years ago. i’ve watched all my friends go away to college, move out, become functioning adults and completely forget about me. and i’m living with my parents getting maybe $20 a month in allowance. sad, i know. but i’ve applied for jobs. everyday i look for a new place to send my pathetic résumé. been doing that for a while now. no calls back. my parents are overworked and stressed and they take it out on me. i don’t blame them, if they hadn’t had me they’d be doing pretty good in life. i just want to become something, really anything at this point, i just want them to be proud of me for once and i don’t fucking know how. i’m so fucking stuck and tired. it took me 18 years to grow into the useless worthless piece of garbage i am today and i couldn’t be more over it. just want to sleep forever. 18 years was way too long for me and i’m done now"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of exhaustion, hopelessness, and self-deprecation.

"Post: These parents physically hurt their teenage daughter by burning her with hot oil and hitting her with broomsticks due to her refusal to marrying a man much older than her who is paying $20,000. This horrendous story just goes to show that your family isn't always this happy loving caring group of people who want the best for you. Sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs, and it's very important to know when to say no, and walk away if you can. Especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what, It becomes very hard to go against them and say no, but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/parents-daughter-abuse-forced-marriage-texas-cooking-oil-beat-bexar-county-maarib-al-hishmawi-a8274001.html"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Got rejected again today. I have had this massive crush on this girl for a while now and we been getting along really well. I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her. I decided today I would suprise her with an early Valentine's Day gift and maybe she would like it. Nothing huge, I got her favorite snack and a brief note telling her how I felt. I don't know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I can't blame her for how she feels, it's her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong. On top of all the other shit going on in my life, I don't see a good reason to continue this fruitless struggle to survive."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love Dear (future) B, This letter may be fragmented. This letter may be short, or it may be long. This letter may be emotional. Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotions you experience when you feel vulnerable and [falsely] unloved. Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It’s hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far you’ve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you’d like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more “needy.” Listen to me: You are not validated by someone’s ability (or lack thereof) to love you. And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. So far in your healing process you’ve managed to understand the importance of detachment. You’re making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not “incomplete” without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of “wholeness” outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didn’t because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Don’t forget that you’ve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but that’s exactly what this letter is for. As you’ve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. You’re done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. You’re done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. You’re done feeling unimportant or unloved because you’re not someone’s first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether she’s in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. When you feel like he’s pulling away, don’t push harder. When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isn’t that he doesn’t love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things. Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You’re the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character. Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first. Isn’t it just like me to start taking the advice I’ve been given by so many people my entire life. Love yourself. Respect yourself. Appreciate your own time. Respect others. Respect other’s need for space. Live for you. Again, love yourself. With love, B, 12/3/2017."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of very severe depression.

"Post: Need advice on a friendship! Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk. I’m usually the one who texts first"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses some frustration and self-doubt regarding their friendship and their ability to engage in conversation, there is no mention of profound hopelessness, despair, or lack of enjoyment in activities. The post primarily seeks advice on the dynamics of their friendship and the potential complications that arise from differences in personality and communication styles. The overall tone is more concerned and seeking guidance rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: Reluctant to get diagnosed I'm reluctant to go to the doctor and find out if I have depression. I can't exactly explain this, but it's a combination of a few things. Part of me feels that I'm asking to be depressed and another part of me fears that I don't have depression and my problems are all just my own fault."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses hesitancy and reluctance to seek a diagnosis for depression, suggesting that the poster may be experiencing some internal conflict or fear surrounding this issue. They mention a belief that they may be ""asking to be depressed,"" indicating a possible negative self-perception or guilt.

"Post: Every-time I look in the mirror. I see somebody else. I don't know who I am anymore, it's like I'm a stranger in my own body."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong sense of disconnect and alienation from one's own self.

"Post: theres nothing to look forward to i used to tell myself that after high school things will improve, I can get away from home and college will be fun. i guess i wont really know until im there, but im not excited at all for college.

"Post: What happened? Hi guys, Just wondering if any of you have experienced this. I grew up in the happiest family ever. My mom and dad were always so happy and positive about everything in life. I'm 30 now, things have changed so much. It is mainly my mother. She is very negative about everything. Nothing ever gets her excited, she doesn't want to do anything. She doesn't want to have family to visit them anymore. She doesn't really want to go out. As long as she's at home with her dogs she's ""happy"" She is basically miserable and moody every single day. I really don't understand it. She was never like this. Have any of you had this? What did you do to deal with it? It's like she prefers being negative over anything. Nothing gets her excited. Nothing makes her happy? It's so shit."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does express a sense of concern and confusion about the change in the poster's mother's behavior. However, it does not primarily focus on the poster's own emotional state or express feelings of overwhelming distress or hopelessness. The tone of the post is more rooted in frustration and disappointment rather than deep emotional pain. While the situation described may be difficult and cause some emotional distress, it does not align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Cold turkey off antidepressants for over a month. I’ve been cold turkey from my antidepressants for over a month. Sounds stupid to say that I completely forgot to take them for two weeks but I have been doing so many different jobs over the summer that I’ve hardly been home. For the first couple of weeks, I was fine. Now as time has gone on, the suicidal thoughts have returned along with extremely low moments, mania and anxiety attacks. I would NOT recommend going cold turkey. I can’t believe I have been THAT stupid. I’ve just taken my first antidepressant just now. 😞"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post showcases several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression.

They discuss forgetting to take their medication for two weeks, which implies a lack of regularity in their mental health treatment.

The use of negative language such as ""stupid"" and expressing regret further emphasizes their distress. The post ends with a sad face emoticon, which conveys a sense of sadness and hopelessness. All of these factors suggest a severe depressive episode and a need for immediate support and professional intervention."
"Post: What's wrong with my dad and what should I do about him? (sorry for the long post) I wasn't sure where to post this, so I just put it under r/family. A bit of background info: My parents have been divorced since I was 4. For as long as I can remember, my dad's been threatening the things I like to keep me in line. When I was 5 or 6, I had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if I didn't play the piano. These days, he threatens to sell my phone and my computer (which he knows I need for homework) when I don't attend swim practice at a club I've been going to for years. He's also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces (which cost about $5000) because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice. Not to mention she's unemployed. He's also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he's gotten mad. He called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my mom's house, and he's called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood. He often tries to guilt-trip me when I piss him off, usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while I waste my time on my computer. There was a point back in 6th and 7th grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse, but he's improved since then and it gave me hope that he'd stop the threats and angry rants. Also, he rarely goes through with his threats, although that doesn't make them any less hurtful. Besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts, he's a generally normal parent. I can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody, but I'm afraid she can't handle the financial burden of having me full-time. I'm also a little suspicious of her because I remember her hitting me before my parents divorced, even though she denies it. However, she's a much better parent than my dad right now. So my questions are: Should I consider my dad abusive? Should I take action?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post describes a difficult and emotionally challenging situation involving the poster's father, but it does not exhibit the strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The focus of the post is on seeking advice regarding the situation with the poster's father and the potential actions they should take. While there may be distress and concern expressed, it does not reach the level of hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post is more pragmatic and seeking guidance rather than displaying overwhelming emotional distress."
Post: Is my sons mother justified in demanding I stop trying to give my 17 month old son a high five? I was recently told that giving him high fives during our last visit resulted in him hitting more than usual. I don't understand how she formed this correlation given there were significant other factors at play. I really need some advice on this one. My family thinks this is just another reason for her to limit and restrict my access to him.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily focuses on a specific situation regarding the poster's interaction with their child's mother and seeking advice on whether their actions are justified.

"Post: I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long. Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me. So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there). Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either. So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me. There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end. I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a plethora of emotional indicators consistent with very severe depression. The poster expresses feeling the lowest they have ever been and reveals a desire to die. They describe feeling lonely and believing nobody cares about them. The poster also describes feeling undeserving of time and attention from friends, feeling like a rebound when their friends are not around, and constantly worrying about others' expectations and judgments. They talk about struggling with self-worth, engaging in self-harm, and feeling like a waste. The overall tone is one of hopelessness, despair, and a desperate desire for someone to show them love and care. These feelings align with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: My male cousin stopped talking to me all of sudden. Let's call my cousin Bobby. My mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week. I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze. I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post reveals a strong emotional impact with the sudden change in the cousin's behavior. The poster expresses feelings of confusion, hurt, and rejection, evident in their detailed recounting of their close relationship and the sudden disconnect. The lack of explanation for the cousin's behavior and the continued avoidance of interaction despite his age and maturity level indicate a significant emotional impact on the poster. While not all the symptoms highlighted in the previous example are explicitly mentioned, the emotional distress and negative impact on the poster's well-being align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

"Post: How are you? I am not okay. I’m in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really don’t know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldn’t attend classes because I wasn’t feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldn’t have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasn’t joking. Sometimes I get these sort of “impulses”, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I’ve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Currently they’ve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she’d been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didn’t know until hours later, and told her that I wasn’t at school and made a concerning remark, but I don’t know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didn’t pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didn’t care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just don’t know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it’s all her fault and I don’t know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I don’t understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I’ve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I’ve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, I’m sleeping the days away because I can’t bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I’m too much of a coward to face reality. I’m trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses deep emotional pain and despair. The writer describes feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts and impulses, including thoughts of suicide.

"Post: I know I am depressed but I have no energy to do anything to counter it. I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression. Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then. These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application. I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic. Nothing has changed, and I'm still deep in depression."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes a lack of energy and motivation, as well as a prolonged period of job searching without success, which can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and despair.

"Post: Anyone get this feeling? Does anyone else get the feeling like you're waiting for something to happen? Something great that will change your life for the better and make you finally happy.

"Post: What's wrong with me? I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is ""I don't care"", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation?

Post: I’m glad none of my close friends know I have reddit If my friends knew how depressed I was and I how serious I am about committing suicide they would probably put me in some inpatient program.

"Post: I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?) **TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? **Long Story (detailed)**: My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck. On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I'm feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless.

"Post: I’m losing the girl I’ve been with for 7 years and it’s because of my drug use, really bummed I’ve been with this girl since 9th grade I’m now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I’ve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesn’t matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I’d get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I’ve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldn’t believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldn’t do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldn’t sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I don’t want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I’m very upset that I let this happen, currently I just can’t keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I can’t get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I’m going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I can’t seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I’d rather be dead then to live without her and I don’t know what else to do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: OPINIONS PLEASE/SISTER ISSUE I’m a 43 year old single mom of a 21 year old son. I suffer from major depressive disorder, ocd, ptsd and anxiety. I work part time and live with my mother. I’ve had issues since I was a child. So I believe my sister and I can be jealous of each other. Her of me because I’ve had issues and me of her because she’s normal. Our father passed away 4 years ago. Which was a devastating loss for all of us. I have lived and raised my son with my parents for the last 12 years or so. My sister moved away about 12 years ago and got married had two kids got divorced, had another kid and recently got married. She is a busy mother of 3 and working full time. After my dad passed my mother and I decided to move closer to my sister and her family. I admit I have issues and my sister is the type that I feel truly doesn’t “believe” in my issues. She sees me as lazy, crazy, etc. I see her roll her eyes when she thinks I’m being too much. She never asks me to help her out I guess because of my issues. I moved here to be closer to her and I feel abandoned. She has no time for me. We are building a house together, my mom and I have an inlaw suite and my sister and her family have the main house. My mother has given them the money to put a down payment on this home. At times I am pissed especially when she throws in my face that there are certain things that I want in the building of the house that are going to cost extra. She is a hard core bitch at times. She hardly shows any love. Her job has her so tied up that she doesn’t take care of herself, sometimes puts off taking her kids to the dr, she has no time to go out with us. She can’t even take time to respond to any of my texts during the day. She makes fun of me in indirect ways, “I didn’t really mean it” when I have a memory issue (from depression treatments). But when I respond with FU it isn’t quite so funny anymore and she’s done with me. My mom is so torn she hates that we feel this way towards each other. My mom has been there for us both thru thick and thin, financially and emotionally. I just want a sister, someone who’s going to have my back once my mom is gone. I have no one else. Help me, Am I just jealous of her? How do I fix this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

At dinner, they were making jokes about how I'm not gonna graduate and how I'm not gonna get a job. My mom knows about my depression and even my past suicide attempt and self-harm. She just decides to brush it under the rug and act like it doesn't exist. I tell her how I am trying my hardest and how I gave it my all and she is just thinking that I am lazy. This is all bullshit.

"Post: I can't do school work and I have no will power left The past two years I've been having a mental battle with myself trying to do my work just to come out with bad grades and disappointment from myself and my parents. I don't if I'm depressed, an idiot, or just a lazy piece of shit but I'm tired of fighting and I just want to throw in the towel. I know my parents just want the best for me but they can't help me. Even when I'm in class it takes all my mental strength to do the simplest things like take notes. The most frustrating part is that nobody thinks I try to do anything. Everyone treats me like a complete dumbass because I can't do my work. I used to have an amazing memory when I was 5-6 years old but when I started elementary school and now it gets worse and worse every year. Sometimes I'll talk to someone and forget what we're talking about in the middle of the conversation for a second. I can't organize anything and I give up before I even try because I know in my head I won't be able to do it anyways. I couldn't pay attention in class if you payed me to do it. And I hate myself for it. I hate that I can't do simple tasks and I that I can't remember anything but I can't control it. It doesn't even feel like I'm in control of my life anymore. Is there anything I can do to help myself. I'm trying to change my diet and meditate as of recent. I want to be in control of myself again. I'm only in 8th grade and I feel like here's one last chance of hope before I trash my gpa and end up working at McDonald's. If you can think of anything that might help please reply.

"Post: I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing. The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help. I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's. Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture. Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot. Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that. Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell. tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses feelings of depression, as the individual describes transitioning from constant panic attacks and anxiety to deep depression. They indicate that being depressed provides a sense of relief and comfort, describing it as a state of calmness and not caring about anything. The individual also admits to having engaged in harmful behavior, implying that their depression has had a negative impact on their actions.

"Post: Why does my mom keep talking to me? She says Im not nice like I used to be. She was like the older I get the more understanding i should be. She also feels like I should seek wealth. But that's not something I want. I want personal growth and wisdom and strength. I know a lot may disagree and say money is what matters. Yes it does. But it's a tool. Also, I do dislike my mother because she messed up my head as I grew up. She always told me her issues. Parents should never tell kids their issues. I am 22 now and she feels like she can still change the way I am. But in my opinion, the first three years is what shapes most of a person. I want to move out. I want to buy a bike, a tent and a sleeping bag and leave... what do you guys think?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays some level of emotional distress and dissatisfaction with the poster's relationship with their mother.

So, i meet this girl on the internet in my later 17's , i was an active practitioner of Karate Kyokushin, Muay Thai and Box back then, i was about to enter in the amateurs and start to compete, i even went to japan 2 times on the championship and training grounds. Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that. When i meet this girl (I'd call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else. She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ''man''. So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love don't reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i'm talking..

I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, don't worry about it, we're gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ''major reason '' for that and i was happy with her. Then Kim's past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim. The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she couldn't find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i wouldn't give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to : 1- Help my parents 2- ""Pay"" For her in the house. I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2 things i didn't have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me . We would visit Kim's daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim's Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her. I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?"" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that's why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it's fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off.

Well, time had passed, we didn't talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say ""What about we did a lil shot ? "" (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to ""LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was ""What ?"" and she ""Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want"" . It's unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast.

"Post: I feel like I haven’t done a good enough job of enjoying my childhood. As someone who recently turned 18, I feel like I’ve started the next part of my life and given my childhood a finite end. I wish I wasn’t like that but I just feel less and less connected to the kid I was as every day passes. What’s the worst is that I feel like I might’ve missed the best part of my life and wasted my one shot to enjoy it as much as I could.

"Post: I often ponder the idea of giving up completely. Has anyone given up completely? How does it feel like? I have had extreme depression for 11 years. For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think “what if I gave up?” And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes. For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and didn’t even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it. During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I haven’t stopped. I regularly do thing I don’t want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc. Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it’s getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what I’m doing and give up.

"Post: I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people don’t seek out professional help I don’t know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household. I feel immigrants’ families are typically a very work focused group. They expect you to just tough it out and push through everything . Most people in these communities don’t see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There’s almost a macho type mindset that you aren’t supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks. It’s pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because it’s “for crazies”. I’ve been chronically depressed for years but I’m finally going to seek professional help Monday. I’ve been having suicidal tendencies for years and if I ever have kids, which I very much hope I do one day, I’ll be damned if they feel they can’t come to me to talk about any bad thoughts."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with cultural attitudes towards seeking professional help for mental health issues. The poster describes living in a Hispanic/American household where there is a strong emphasis on work and a perception that depression is seen as laziness or being unmotivated.

"Post: my cousin Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence. I'm starting to ramble but the main goal of this post was to find out if anyone feels the same way about any of their younger family members or if I'm just a complete asshole."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

Reasoning: The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts, indicating a high level of emotional distress and despair. The use of strong language, self-blame, and frustration towards life further emphasizes the severity of the poster's emotional state.

"Post: Is this my fault? I've been on SSI ever since high school but before high school I wasn't. My oldest aunt suggest to me to get SSI but let's call her Cancer Rat because her zodiac sign is a Cancer. I was like ""Nah, I'm good for now"" because I'm lazy I didn't feel like doing that but I didn't tell my aunt that! SO, she took it the wrong way and start yelling BLAH, BLAH THIS and BLAH, BLAH THAT. My mom was like ""Cancer Rat you cannot get mad because she decided not to do that!"" Cancer Rat gotten more mad ""I'm not mad, I was just saying."" I gotten tired of her yelling because she can't get her way. I was like ""Mom, let's just do it so Cancer Rat can shut the FUUUUUCK UP!"" My mom was like ""Ok, let's just do it. Let's get it over with."" The thing is ever since then I was in 3rd or 4th grade the relationship between Cancer Rat and I went down hill! I stopped going to church with is where is start going down hill. She got mad because I stopped going to church with her. From time to time Cancer Rat will bring it up to manipulate me to have me feel guilty about it but I caught on to it. She makes fun of my weight, hair, clothes I wear, what I eat and drink, just everything like she's overdramatic about every fucking thing I do but I'm probably ain't the only one though. It's so bad that I can't even read a story on the Wattpad without her bitch ass accusing me of texting a boy when I wasn't! She probably hates when I play video games. In 2016 she called me mentally retarded and said I don't think straight but I don't know why and if I ask her why she said that to me that she'll just lie, lie, lie of why she said it. She gets overdramatic when she's the last to find out shit or when you stop telling her shit, stop talking to her. I stop telling shit because you'll tell her not to say anything to anyone that she'll do it anyways. She did all of this ever since I was in 3rd or 4th grade and still is til this day.. Now you know my back story with Cancer Rat. Ever since 2014 I started to use Bitcoins and the only person knows I use it is my mom at the time but my brother started to find out and he ended up founding out. From 2014 to 2017 I will lose Bitcoins and wins or earn Bitcoins! Just like if I were to use the trade market, you'll win or lose some. In 2018 I wanted to make history by making thousands of dollars from a $29.00 Bitcoin investment and I did. The problem is that Cancer Rat daughter, let's call her Tuna Fish in her 30's. So I made 2 mil but the household only knew about it. Until I made a big mistake by making a youtube video about my 2 mil and shared the video to my Facebook! The mistake was sharing it to my Facebook page. Here's the thing…Tuna Fish love to lurk on people Facebook pages using her husbands account and I wasnt paying attention until after my aunt Cancer Rat confronted me about my earnings 3 days after I shared the link to my Facebook. Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that accused me of using SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back, that I didn't even bother to let her help, that I was being greedy, I didn't even bother to tell her, that she had heard it through someone else how they showed her proof, that the person had showed her a video of it, she's disappointed in me, she will forgive but won't forget, and that she feels lefted out. Here's the thing I did use SSI to get the 2 mil because back in 2015 and 2016 that Cancer Rat b•tch ass sent a letter to them told a false story how I barely go places, that my mom have to do all the work, that I'm mentally retarded, that I rage on video games, other sh•t that I can't remember and one of the update application for SSI that Cancer Rat lied to them and said that I was in a wheel chair when I never was. So that's when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't my fault to me because I wasn't the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says ""Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it's not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn't do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!"" She was pissed but I don't give a fuck. I said ""I had to do what I gotta do! It's not my fault that it happen. The reason why I turn $29 to 2 mil is because some bitch trying to sabotage my SSI by sending in false letters and I wonder who? Now you're mad because I made 2 mil before my 21st birthday OMG!"" so Cancer Rat"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits some emotional distress and frustration, but it does not primarily focus on symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster expresses anger towards their aunt, whom they refer to as Cancer Rat, and shares details about conflicts and manipulative behavior within their family. There is mention of financial struggles and a desire to make money using Bitcoins, but this does not necessarily indicate depression. The overall tone of the post suggests more frustration and resentment rather than profound hopelessness or despair."
"Post: Songs for children :) Hello! I recently launched a YouTube channel with fun videos for children and I'd like some feedback on the content, and I thought it would be a good idea to get feedback from parents or big sisters/brothers, etc. And if you also have suggestions as to what kind of content would be fun and educational for children I'd love to hear them. I am writing these songs so I basically decide what the story and the animation will be about. This is the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqEBnulrK-MFM4nwjP3quEQ Thank you, Eduardo"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster is primarily seeking feedback and suggestions for their YouTube channel aimed at children. They express excitement about launching the channel and show enthusiasm for creating content.

"Post: Difficult Family Members I am pretty annoyed I have a large family 8 kids and my mother in law is visiting to take care of placing her mother who lives near us in a memory care home. This is fine, but when my sister in law found out she was driving distance away she decided she was going to come up for a week stay at my home with her 6 kids. So we got stuck acomidating all these people in our home for a week. She didn't ask she just told my mother in law she was coming in 3 days. Didn't offer to help pay for the enormous 300 dollar grocery bill and basically took over the lower level of my home. Now she is gone Serously pissed. Am I wrong to so annoyed. There is reunion coming up and I was going to tell every one hell to the no is anyone staying here again."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses annoyance and frustration regarding a family situation. While the poster is upset about their sister-in-law's unexpected visit and the burden it placed on them, there are no indications of deep emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post is more centered around anger and annoyance, rather than profound emotional distress. Therefore, it is unlikely that the poster suffers from depression based on this post."
"Post: No friends whatsoever. Living in isolation. Please help me I'm in my final semester of undergrad. I'm 24. I live in a university apartment. I have severe social anxiety. I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance. Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now. I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further. I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible. I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I don't think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I'd feel better. But I've given up almost all hope."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a deep sense of isolation, severe social anxiety, and a long-standing pattern of avoiding social interactions. They express feelings of insecurity, body dysmorphia, and an eating disorder, which likely contribute to their self-esteem issues. The mention of constantly fantasizing about suicide is a significant red flag for severe depression, as is the belief that having someone there for them could provide some relief. The overall tone of hopelessness, despair, and resignation, coupled with the inability to see a way out of their current situation, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Do you get colds often? My immune system sucks, I basically get a cold monthly and sometimes bi-monthly. I feel it sneaking up on me now . I have my questions that these frequent colds are from my anxiety keeping me up and lack of sleep and stress. Does this affect anyone else?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster frequently gets colds and suspects that their anxiety, lack of sleep, and stress may be contributing factors. This suggests that the poster is experiencing both physical symptoms (frequent colds) and emotional symptoms (anxiety, lack of sleep, stress) that are potentially interrelated. While the post does not explicitly mention depression, it does imply that the poster may be struggling with their mental health, as anxiety and stress are commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of the post also conveys a sense of frustration and concern, indicating that the poster may be experiencing emotional distress."
"Post: Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could've gone better. Hello, Reddit. I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment. Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed. I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about? Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left. She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning. I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone. ...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a deep sense of emotional pain and vulnerability. The poster describes their struggle with depression and anxiety, emphasizing how their mental health has been deteriorating. Opening up to someone for the first time is a significant step, and initially, they feel a genuine sense of hope and support. However, the interaction takes a turn when the person they confided in invalidates their emotions by suggesting they are just ""emo"" and need to ""toughen up."" This rejection and dismissal of their feelings are deeply hurtful, leading to a sense of isolation and despair. The poster expresses their reluctance to open up to anyone else in the future and a lack of motivation to engage in social connections due to their ongoing struggle with daily functioning. This emotional distress and hopelessness align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The mention of crying themselves to sleep and the intention to maintain a ""fake personality"" for their friend further indicates a deep emotional struggle and the potential presence of depression."
"Post: How can I Kill the negativity inside my head? As I'm on my self improvement journey, even though I'm making progress, I hear a voice in my head telling me horrible thoughts. It's lowkey making me depressed. It says stuff like ""you're so shit,"" ""you're fat so you might as well not even try with women,"" ""your grades are horrible,"" ""your hair isn't cool yet,"" and ""oh so you can dress well now but you're still a shit person overall."" Even when I have an accomplishment like a successful concert or a new track of music, my jerk brain still tells me that I'm shit and not good enough. Maybe I just need to hit the iron harder and keep getting in shape? How can I kill this voice? It's ruining my self esteem and happiness."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses negative thoughts and self-critical beliefs that are affecting the poster's self-esteem and happiness. The use of phrases like ""horrible thoughts,"" ""making me depressed,"" and ""ruining my self-esteem and happiness"" shows the emotional distress caused by these negative voices in their head. The poster also mentions being on a self-improvement journey and making progress, indicating a potential desire to improve their mental well-being. However, they express frustration and a lack of success in silencing these negative thoughts, which is consistent with symptoms of depression. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of hopelessness and a struggle to overcome the pervasive negativity in their mind."
"Post: Looking for Friends I’m looking for people to talk to about my depression. An online friendship, I guess. I just have no one in my life who understands what I’m going through and it makes dealing with this much worse."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ",yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of loneliness and a desire for connection with others who can understand and empathize with the poster's experience of depression. The mention of having no one in their life who understands adds to the feelings of isolation and the difficulty of dealing with depression alone. This emotional distress and longing for support align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.

Reasoning: The post reflects emotional distress with mentions of anxiety and depression. The poster expresses a desire to help themselves by volunteering, indicating a proactive approach to managing their mental health. However, they also express a sense of disappointment and hurt from being fired due to attendance issues. This suggests a potential impact on their self-esteem and exacerbation of their anxiety and depression. The overall tone conveys a sense of hopelessness and frustration, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do... Ok so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out. I will go into more details if anyone is willing to help me and thank u for hearing me out.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several key indicators of very severe depression. The poster mentions that their girlfriend is planning on killing herself and expresses their utmost concern and confusion about what to do. This indicates a deep sense of emotional distress and hopelessness. The poster also describes their girlfriend's history of self-harm, the difficult family situation, and her fluctuating moods. These factors contribute to a heightened level of emotional distress and potential mental health issues. The mention of the girlfriend feeling like a bad girlfriend and treating the poster poorly suggests feelings of low self-worth and self-esteem, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that their girlfriend is behind in school and lacks genuine friendships, further contributing to stress and negative emotional experiences."
"Post: What’s the point in living? Obviously with the title you would think I’m sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, there’s truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. I’ve tried different things to try and discover myself like spending 1500 dollars on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. I’ve bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now I’m in the process of selling it. I have 1 friend that I hang out with once a month. I have 2 real life friends that I text occasionally. I haven’t had a girlfriend in several years now. Mind you I turn 20 years old tomorrow. I don’t know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? I’ve had a small problem with taking pain killers like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just don’t find any joy in any part of my life. I don’t want to die, but at the same time I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I don’t want to be like this, but I’ve tried different things all my life and I’ve lost all joy. Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it. To clarify, I don’t consider myself suicidal. I don’t WANT to die. I WANT a reason to be alive."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses feelings of hopelessness, emptiness, and a lack of fulfillment in life. The poster discusses trying various activities and hobbies in an attempt to find purpose or passion but ultimately feeling lost and joyless. They also mention a small problem with taking painkillers, which could indicate self-medication or a coping mechanism for emotional distress. The overall tone is one of deep dissatisfaction with life and a desire to find meaning. These factors suggest that the poster is likely experiencing symptoms of depression."
"Post: AIBU TO THINK that calling mum and dad ""mummy and daddy"" after a certain age is cringe? My sister is 30 years old and still refers to our parents as ""mummy and daddy"". I can't be the only one to find this totally cringey?? I could understand more if it was directed at them but it's to others to when talking about them. Today we went for a meeting with our landlord and discussing the smell of weed coming from the flat below. When she said ""I don't mind it so much myself, but it's just more when mummy and daddy come to visit I don't want them to be smelling it in the hall"". I felt like disappearing into the ground😒 Just me?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The main topic of the post is a personal opinion about whether it is cringey to refer to parents as ""mummy and daddy"" after a certain age. While there is a mention of feeling embarrassed or wanting to disappear into the ground, this does not indicate overwhelming emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking validation or understanding from others rather than expressing profound hopelessness or despair."
Post: Parents don’t care After 10+ years of dealing with my depression alone I showed interest to both of my parents about going to a therapist and they both shrugged it off.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ",yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of emotional pain and loneliness. The poster shares their experience of dealing with depression on their own for over 10 years and feeling alone in their struggles. The fact that they showed interest in going to therapy and both of their parents shrugged it off indicates a lack of support or understanding from their parents. This lack of support from loved ones can further contribute to feelings of isolation and can be indicative of a depressive state. The emotional distress and the lack of support from parents align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.

The poster describes making a fool of themselves at work and feeling stupid, which suggests a negative self-perception and possibly low self-esteem.

"Post: Best friend has a bf and is MIA I want to start a thread for people who have best friends/friends who have been MIA as a possible result from having a bf/gf. Please share your stories and give advice to those who post. So here’s my story: So my best friend of five years has had a boyfriend for over a year now. However, she’s recently been MIA. There has been times where I hadn’t seen her for two weeks or maybe a month, but this time it was a lot more. Despite living a few minutes away from me, I hadn’t seen her in 2 months!! Every time I asked her to hang out she would say that she was busy, but she wouldn’t suggest meeting another time. We barely texted around this time either, I was the one that mostly initiated the conversations. Although she was busy, she was able to meet up with her boyfriend plenty of times who happens to live an hour away from her. She would always post photos of them together in social media and I would honestly feel upset. Eventually, I asked her to hang out again and she said that she had plans to go to the movies that night with someone else(not her bf), but that I could join. So we went to the movies and she dropped me off to my house right after the movie because she had to wake up early the next day. So we didn’t really talk (since it’s the movies) and I couldn’t address how I felt about not seeing her since there was someone else there as well. Also, the only reason I saw her that one time is because I asked her to hang out. If I hadn’t texted her, then she wouldn’t have invited me and I wouldn’t have seen her. After that I didn’t see her for a while either and I wanted to meet with her in person so that I could speak to her. A couple weeks later we finally saw each other. The first thing I told her was how I felt upset because I felt like she wasn’t making much of an effort to even talk to me or see me. I told her that we should see each other more and she agreed. She then caught me off guard by stopping me and saying “I know what you’re going to say.” She claims that she knew and that she had been feeling guilty for the past months. She then said that those months were kind of hectic because her bf was going through something. But that’s it... she didn’t apologize and it just doesn’t sit right with me. All she said was how she felt guilty and then mentioned something about her boyfriend to justify her behavior for the past months. We hung out for a couple of hours, however her bf kept calling her and she’d answer his calls during this time. She’d recently gone on a short vacation and I didn’t know when she’d returned to town until I saw a photo on Instagram of her and her boyfriend together. I’m honestly very mad and I feel as though I can’t say anything because I had already mentioned it. What pisses me off more is when she had just gone on vacation for two days and posted a photo of her boyfriend on social media with the caption “It’s only been 2 days and I miss you sooo much!!” Like are you seriously kidding me, you hadn’t seen your friend in more than two months... I’m honestly so mad and I feel like I can’t tell her without her getting mad. She’ll probably get defensive since it involves her bf and since I mentioned it before. She’s honestly the only best friend I have and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m starting to resent them and I don’t want to. Is there any advice that anyone can give me?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post shows some signs of emotional distress, but it does not exhibit strong indications of very severe depression. The poster expresses frustration, anger, and feelings of being neglected by their best friend, who is prioritizing their relationship with their boyfriend over their friendship. While there is some emotional turmoil and a sense of resentment, the primary focus of the post is seeking advice and asking for help in navigating the situation. It does not convey the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post appears more concerned with the interpersonal dynamics of the friendship rather than overwhelming emotional distress."

"Post: Reddit sucks, and I’ve decided to delete it. Anytime I go outside the depression sub my opinions and comments are just shitted on because I’m not the same fake moral high or smug asshole that most other people on reddit seem to be. “Oh you have a non leftist opinion? Fuck you then!” Like seriously this is reddit front page in a nut shell and even any smaller sub Reddit’s there’s still a bunch of assholes everywhere. I come on here in an attempt to aid my depression but even on this sub, though allot of people are nice and kind and I really appreciate everyone’s kind words, it’s not helping me and I’m just gonna stop wasting my time.

Post: Currently waiting at the hospital to be seen If I don't get treatment I am going to kill myself. No one in my daily life cares. My sister and my mom didn't give a shit.

I don't want to live at all," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys intense emotional distress and hopelessness. The poster expresses thoughts of self-harm and mentions feeling broken and not wanting to live. The lack of support from family and the recent breakup with an abusive boyfriend further contribute to feelings of despair and isolation. The mention of wanting to live in a hospital ward and not wanting to think suggests a desire for escape from their current emotional state. These signs align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, specifically the presence of suicidal ideation and a strong sense of hopelessness."

"Post: I feel so down and disappointed sometimes I am 29 female and on verge of breaking down completely. I am facing a lot of rejections in life only because I don't look so beautiful in front of others eyes. I just don't believe that saying ""Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder"" .

"Post: I'm just waste of sperm Where to start? Well I only life with my mom in shit apartment(my dad was alcoholic ect.) My mom is in debt because of school.. and has been in dept all her life. So all my 17 years we are poor. Sometimes we live without electricity because she can't pay in time. In school when there's a road trip to somewhere I don't go and say I don't want to go because I can't afford. (sometimes I want to go but most of the time I don't because of my mental illness.. ) Sometimes i don't have nothing to eat for dinner . All my 17 years I only eat 2 different food at home..potatoes or pasta. Because we are poor my teeth are really bad of eating all the shit junk food. I just don't smile anymore.

Post: It's my cakeday today. Idk why but it makes me happy," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post mentions that it's the poster's cakeday and that it makes them happy. This indicates that the poster is experiencing some level of joy or happiness from this event. While it's difficult to determine the severity of the depression based on this post alone, the mention of finding happiness in a small event like a cakeday suggests that the poster may be actively seeking and appreciating moments of happiness. This does not align with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, which typically involve a pervasive sense of hopelessness and an inability to experience joy or pleasure. Therefore, the label would not indicate that the poster suffers from depression in this case."
Post: I learned how to fail my friendships with this book.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not provide enough information or emotional indicators to determine whether the poster suffers from depression.

Additional context would be needed to make a definitive determination."
"Post: Hosted my sister’s baby shower, only to be a second thought the next day Hi Reddit! I’m wondering if I’m being too emotional about this and could use your opinion. I flew from Utah to Boston and arrived Thursday morning on a red eye. From 6am Thursday to 3am Saturday, my mom and I prepped for my sisters baby shower. I see her once or twice a year, but the three of us talk almost everyday on a group chat, and we’re close. My mom and I stopped prepping briefly Friday night to meet her, her husband, and her best friend (who flew in that night) for dinner- so that was the first time I was seeing her this trip, same as her friend. The best friend stayed at her house while I was staying with my mom. So Saturday we had the shower for 25 people. Huge hit. Sister was very very appreciative and loved it. I had brought my suitcase in the event I slept over there, so I could have more time with her Sunday morning. This is generally normal. Once the shower wrapped, her friend brought my suitcase down...sort of a “here you go, bye.” The main Sunday plan was to watch the AFC game back at her house, at 3pm. I woke up after some major sleep catch up at 10:30 and asked the mom/sister group text, “what should we do today kids??” To which my sister replied that her and her girlfriend are getting breakfast and meeting up with the girlfriend’s husband’s cousin (who also lives in Boston) and that they’d be back at the house at 2:30 before the game. My flight back to Utah is 6am Monday, so today (Sunday) was really the only time to see her. I didn’t respond to that message. Around 1pm I told my mom that I didn’t want to watch the game with them, and I’d rather go downtown and watch it in a bar since I was feeling extremely hurt after putting all that work in for her shower, and then feel like an after thought the next day. So, Mom and I went to a bar and watched it. Sister and her husband blew up at me for being so “selfish” and are not talking to me. Husband went so far as to say I’m not welcome to see the baby when he comes. Crazy. I guess I should have put a smile on my face and just showed up for the game at 3? I would have if I ever stopped crying. Thoughts??"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and hurt. The poster describes putting in a significant amount of effort and time to host their sister's baby shower, only to be treated as a second thought the next day. They express feeling hurt and rejected, especially after seeing their sister prioritize spending time with her friend and her friend's husband's cousin over spending time with them. The poster mentions feeling extremely hurt and even crying, suggesting a strong emotional response to the situation. This emotional distress aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and rejection."
"Post: I am so fucking lonely... My husband is my best friend. Hes my dude. And when hes busy I have friends to fall back on as well. Recently the whole family got back to back sickness and we were basically quarantined for two weeks just bumming around trying to get better. So I let my kid watch too much tv, let my husband play all the video games, so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well. Let me also say, I didnt plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end, but I have to shower, and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever (no...). Now that were better his behaviors have continued, even though i have spoke to him many times; things wont be like this when were not longer sick. My kid isn't a tv kid and I plan to keep it that way as long as I can.. but he.. he doesn't want to spend time with me any more, just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together... so I wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom... and I realized I don't have very many friends. EDIT: I don't care about this getting up votes or anything but sharing it makes me feel a little less lonely.. also sorry for any spelling grammatical errors im usually obsessive but i feel like shit tl;dr: Husband plays games:: stops communicating with me :: Realized hes my only true friend."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of loneliness and disappointment in the poster's relationships, specifically with their husband. They describe feeling abandoned and neglected, and their attempts to communicate their needs have been unsuccessful. The mention of not having many friends further highlights their emotional isolation. The overall tone of desperation, self-doubt, and feeling like their husband is their only true friend aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I'd be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I'm rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I'm back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying ""Hey dude, how are ya?"" Its been a while"". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I'm so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout. A lot of them fell through. Others postponed till Christmas break. I messaged 28 people one day, desperate to talk to someone. I feel like I will never be anyone's ""everything"" ya know? I want a dog. Not just because its cute and all, but I want a companion that will never forget me, and will love me. I hate myself. Depression sucks. Loneliness sucks. I just want to cry."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post strongly conveys feelings of loneliness, sadness, and a deep sense of emotional pain. The poster describes a shift from being sociable and outgoing to feeling forgotten and isolated. There is a longing for connection and a sense of being left behind by friends. The mention of missing an ex and the impact it has had on their mood for a year indicates a significant emotional distress. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-hatred, and desperation for companionship aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Parents and suicide My siblings and I are little Sh*ts to our mom, we know that. Our mom is already depressed and has anxiety, she told us she would e better off dead, I tried talking to her but she doesn't want to. How do I help her?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a concern for the well-being of the poster's mother who is depressed and has anxiety. The use of profanity and self-deprecating language suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The mention of the mother expressing thoughts of being better off dead is a clear indicator of the severity of her depression. The poster acknowledges their own behavior towards their mom and expresses a desire to help her, highlighting the impact of the situation on their own emotional state. Overall, the post conveys a sense of despair and a need for guidance in dealing with a difficult situation, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Fight! Fight! Fight! Hey Reddit community, I need to know if I’m in the wrong in a certain situation... So a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was “weird” that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think it’s funny and I wasn’t good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we haven’t talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south. I admit I may have overreacted although I don’t think I’m in the wrong, so I refuse to apologize. Any advice, Reddit community? If I believe that I truly wasn’t in the wrong, should I really apologize for how I handled this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily focuses on seeking advice and opinions regarding a situation with a friend. While there is a mention of feeling bugged and anger from the poster, it does not convey the deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or lack of enjoyment typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more about seeking validation and guidance rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: someone offered to purchase my art today... Fucking amazing feeling, but at the same time I still feel like shit. Nothings ever good enough. Oh well"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys conflicting emotions of excitement and feeling like shit, indicating a mix of positive and negative emotions. The poster mentions the amazing feeling of having someone offer to purchase their art, which suggests a sense of accomplishment and validation. However, they also express a feeling that nothing is ever good enough, indicating a lack of self-worth and satisfaction. The overall tone of the post suggests a deep-seated dissatisfaction and self-criticism, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Was it wrong to block my dad's phone? Was it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So I’m just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesn’t know that it doesn’t bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didn’t want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasn’t family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now I’m wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and don’t mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it. The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries). Prior to this fight, I have been working through ‘abandonment’ issues with a therapist. Not hard to understand why… my dad always says things like ‘don’t call me dad’ and ‘don’t come home’, ‘don’t need a daughter like that’ if I don’t do what he says for as long as I can remember. My parents don't know this. I’ve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but I’m undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody. Would really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of emotional distress and potential symptoms of depression. The poster describes a long-standing pattern of conflict with their father, with threats of disownment and hurtful language being used as a means of control. The mention of working through ""abandonment"" issues with a therapist suggests a history of emotional trauma. The poster expresses feelings of uncertainty, guilt, and self-blame regarding their decision to block their father's phone, indicating possible low self-esteem and a negative view of themselves. The mention of considering cutting their father out of their life and seeking 'Asian perspective' on the matter suggests a desire for support and understanding from those who may have similar cultural experiences. These emotions and experiences align with common symptoms of depression, such as low mood, self-doubt, and difficulty in relationships."
"Post: Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be. I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun. Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection. I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of longing and nostalgia for the person the poster used to be. They describe a time in their life where they felt happy, confident, and full of energy, highlighting significant changes and losses that have occurred since then. The poster expresses feelings of depression, self-hatred, and loneliness, describing themselves as a ""shell"" of the person they used to be. They mention looking at old pictures and feeling the urge to cry, indicating a profound emotional pain associated with their current state. The overall tone of the post displays a high level of despair, hopelessness, and a longing for a past that they believe brought them happiness. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: I wish I could disappear and leave it all behind. I've been constantly thinking of jumping in my car and just drive away from all my problems since new years. Is it a crazy idea? I don't think anyone would miss me.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read. I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking ""was she in pain?"" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying.. I feel so empty and full of rage.. I wounder why she left me here.. I wish I could of took it back, I"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Post: I’m not her storage building At the beginning of the year my friend move out (her choice) and my boyfriend moved. She left some stuff behind and I would tell her to come get it all the time it’s a small apartment and there really isn’t any room for me to stores her stuff here. She would just say “yea I’ll be by soon” well a few months ago we we’re cleaning the apartment making room for a baby and told him to take her stuff to storage. Well he must have thrown her carpet cleaner away because she asked for it and we can’t find it. Now she is mad and saying I did her dirty.

Post: Just cut off all of my friends and I’m feeling alone and regretful Posted this to r/advice but I think that wasn’t the right place for it. I just cut ties with nine people who I considered “family” for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I’m working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. ‪Friends are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down. ‬The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I didn’t want anything to do with them. They don’t understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I can’t show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It’s like they hate when I’m productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They’ve told me that I’m a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and it’s just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them? It’s just since I was so attached to them I don’t know how to deal with this situation. I’ve had so many good times and years with them but lately it’s been so difficult.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

The overall tone expresses a deep emotional struggle and confusion about whether they overreacted or should try to reconcile with their friends. These emotional indicators align with the symptoms commonly associated with depression."

I end up freaking out on the inside and my parents just tell me that this is the best part if my life and u should enjoy it. Hesri g that makes me want to kill myself more than the usual amount because I know what torture it is to be alive and if this is the best it gets what is the point. It's currently 12:32 and I'm in the basement after my brother kicked me out of my own bed. I got about 5 mins of sleep before this happened and the part that really pisses me off about it is the fact that I'm an insomniac. It's a miracle I get anything and he just wakes me up. My brother is 10. When he was 8 and 9 he would have tried to drown me multiple times and stab me once. When my diagnosis came around he's been doing everything he can to.push me towards suicide.

"Post: Obesity Is Killing Our Friendship Context - I'm 21 F, my friend is 24 F. Both students living alone. Obesity related health issues don't just run in her family - they've killed almost half her relatives. Six years ago, she ate fine, sure she was ""curvy"" but that was her build, her nature. She went on walks with her friends. Now she can barely make it to her front door. Her cousin - in his teens - died recently from heart failure. Weight related. Yet, she continues to put on weight, eat awful food - like taking home meat double burgers from mc donalds and then re-frying them at home, for breakfast, plus sweets, every day - and also taking energy drinks all day followed by sleeping pills at night. That is, physically, killing her according to her doctors, but there's where our issues as friends start. What's killing out friendship is her desperation - but absolute lack of effort - when it comes to loosing weight. She talks about switching back to eating the things that, when we first met, she loved - banana breakfast smoothies and chicken schnitzel. She even did a Go Fund Me for a stomach reduction surgery. Has seen more nutritionists than I knew existed. Yet whatever happens, she only eats more, or worse. She was told to stop eating pringles, and replace them with a healthy alternative like corn wafers but instead, she swapped them for deep fried pork buns. And so on. Friends have always offered to help, to buddy up, to go with. I've been on diets she ditched the first day. I've been to the gym only to have her ""go bathroom"" out the front door. Everyone else gave up. It doesn't help that her family, Fijian-Indians, seem to see food as the only way to show love. The early years, when she actually tried to diet, they'd constantly bring her fatty treats because they thought she looked too skinny. And of course, she'd eat them. And they'd bring more. I have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she'll try. I've gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don't want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that's what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza. What would you do? I don't want to continue to watch her kill herself, but I can't think of anything I can possibly do to help her change."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does express a sense of frustration and concern for the friend's well-being. However, the primary focus is on the friend's behavior and lack of effort in addressing their weight and health issues. While the poster mentions the friend's desperation and lack of effort, there is no mention of the poster experiencing any significant emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking advice and expressing frustration rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain or despair. Therefore, it is not indicative of depression."

"Post: I need to get this out. Feel free to ignore it.(Potential Triggers: Domestic and parental abuse, self harm, bullying, substance abuse etc. Avoiding detail AMAP) I am so sick of trying to just survive each day. I want more than anything to go out and live my life. I want a job, an apartment, a pet... but instead I’m stuck living with my grandparents because I’m at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad I can BARELY leave my bed. I don’t think I have felt “happy” for more than 10 minutes at any given time in the last 6 months. I applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars I have from when I got really bad, but they never contacted me again...so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head. I’m trying to be a partner to this amazing guy I care a ton about, but I feel so emotionally shut down that I don’t even react to jokes or love anymore. I don’t even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger... Now, I do not have it as bad as a lot of other people. I grew up in a family with a loving (OCD) grandmother, a grandfather, and a (drug addict) mother who all always made sure I had food and a place to sleep. That alone is more than a lot of people get...but every time I try to talk to someone and they don’t respond to me I flip out at them because my mom didn’t want me to interrupt her high. When something goes SLIGHTLY wrong or is a SMIDGE out of place I panic because that’s all I had around me. When someone on the street spits I flinch because my ex’s favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me. When I go downtown I get anxious because that’s where I was publicly beating by a (different yet no les “charming”) ex. I avoid drinking now because I don’t want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and I definitely don’t want to add to my scars...but this is all I have known my whole life. Every time I try to take a step forward, improve myself, or even leave the house to do something I once enjoyed, it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt. The only ways I know how to make money aren’t things I want to do...the only people in my life I want to be around I can’t stand to be near...I feel like I have nothing left to hold onto and I’m drowning! I’d check into the hospital just to get away, but unless I were to actually make an attempt on my life they wouldn’t accept me (but at least we have free healthcare right?)... I just need a day of normal....."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce? Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not. The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background. My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant. We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005. In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009. We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago. We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area. We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune. To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time. She had been working 3 days a week. She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids. She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby. Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years. The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams. Our oldest will be heading to high school next year. Now my wife wants a new baby. She is obsessed with it. It's all she thinks about and all she talks about. She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it. Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again. I don't want another baby. Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12. I don't want to go back there. I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now. We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....). I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life. If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again. Change the kids schools again. Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again. I don't want to do that to them. I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time. I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was. I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again. I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want. Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me? What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit. I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I don’t want to continue like this For the past few years, I’ve found it extremely difficult to talk to my mom. Some family drama happened a while back and ever since then she’s been really tense and on edge. Almost every time we have a conversation it turns into a debate, usually ending in me sobbing and her yelling (I’m not trying to paint myself as the victim; I’ve said some nasty things to her as well). I’m afraid to bring up my anxiety/depression, because whenever I have in the past she rants about how therapy and medication doesn’t work, there are plenty of natural remedies, yada yada yada. I just want to not start panicking every time I’m in public! She’ll often blow things way out of preportion to what they actually are. If my tone changes during a conversation, or I let out a heavier breath, she thinks I’m “talking back” or scoffing at something she said and start yelling and threatening me. I feel like it might be paranoia, and it’s getting worse. I basically dread every interaction I have to have with her, but I would really like to have normal mother/daughter conversations, go shopping, have her help me with homework, whatever. Instead of arguing nonstop from morning till night. I just fucking hate it. Am I being dramatic? If not, what can I do to remedy the situation? If so, then it wouldn’t be the first time."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Friends keep making fun of me? Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken. I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie. But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this. I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend). I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them ""guys stop making fun of me, I didn't kill my dog"" they'd without a doubt say something like ""that's exactly what a dog killer would say!"". I've never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me. Can anyone help me?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

I’ve been going through a really bad depressive episode and today at school someone said “ remember when you were all ‘sunshiney’ and happy and laughed all the time?

"Post: What ambitions are left to aspire to if you don’t want kids? I’m a 27 male surrounded by mombies and a culture that I don’t fit into. I feel like I’ve accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice. (I was doing fine in grad school, they were job prep program. School Psych and a teacher prep program. I withdrew basically because I was apathetic about the job goals/mission. I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge I’ve accumulated, but it just feels like I’m getting old. It feels like friends are moving away, the world is getting smaller, less wondrous. It’s like realizing I’m too old to aspire to great things like being an astronaut or something. I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So I’m asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward? Maybe I’m pessimistic and think the US political situation is horrible and it’s affecting me. But I wonder how older people without kids keep going forward. What pushes them? I firmly do not want my career to be my only reason to live. I do not want to live to work."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Drank too much and ended up in the hospital Let me start this off by saying I’m underage, so that just makes this just so much better. Anyway, a handful of months back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I don’t know what did it, I only drank a few shots, less than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it was destined. Next thing I know, I’m waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. I’m confused as all living hell. My mom just says “you drank the vodka,” looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep. Now I’m ruined. I’m broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon as I think of my family that’s all I can think of. Apparently I was found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two holes in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my father’s head. God I fucking hate myself. I’m not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just makes me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who was forced to restrain me. By the way I don’t remember any of this, all of this my parents told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turns out you ran at your dad screaming, “fuck you I’m gonna kill you” I hate myself. I’m so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. I’ve had multiple emotional breakdowns since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. I’ve made my parents so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think I’m high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got “too fucked up”, but with the emotional rants I’ve had I’m sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself. I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parents beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, it’s constantly unbearable. Nothing feels normal anymore. It hasn’t since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. I’d rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family. I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. I’m selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all less than worthless. If I wasn’t born I’m sure my family would be much more happy. I can’t kill myself, because then I’d kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I don’t know what to do then. I guess slowly shrivel away or hope I get ran over."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: How I Learned About My Birthfather... &amp; My Brother? I remember when I was around 11, my little cousin, Lily, who was 6, came from Cuba to the U.S. with her parents. They stayed in our home for a few months until they were able to find a place. Right before they left for their new home; I was on my computer, I was 12, playing educational computer games. My family is chattering/gossiping in the living room per usual. I never had any interest in the family gossip, I just wanted to be in my own little space/world. Lily was not like that at all, she loved to listen-in on family drama. It was not long until Lily came barging into the room saying: ""I know a secret."" ""What?"" ""Roberto isn't your real dad."" ""Liar."" ""I'm not lying, they're talking about it!"" ""I don't believe you, so just leave me alone."" ""Just ask your mom."" After that she left the room and the seed of doubt was planted in my head. I did not think twice of it at that moment. It sure as hell bothered the hell out of me for days.. then weeks.. and eventually to months, to almost a year. It wasn't long after, I started to doubt it myself. I did not really look like my father, Roberto. He was light-medium brown skin color, I had pale skin with freckles. My mother had a light tan. Things that I did not notice before started to bother me. The difference in skin color, I did not have his last name, there were not baby pictures of him holding me. I did not feel a connection to this man. I was 13, almost 14, when I decided to confront my mom about it while she was organizing important documents. There was something about this that was bugged me was that... I KNEW the answer to her question BEFORE she could respond. I was 99.9% sure already, but I still had that 0.1% in order to fully believe it. ""Mom, can I ask you something?"" ""What?"" ""Is Roberto my real dad?"" ""No."" ""Who is?"" ""I can't talk right now, I'm busy."" It was at that moment that I knew she did not really care to talk about it. Of course, I would bring it up again and she would brush it off just the same. ""I'm busy,"" or ""Not right now."" After a while, I stopped communicating with my mother and our relationship has suffered, to this day, because of it. It was not long after my mother asked for a divorce to my step-father. I remember her sitting me down on the couch and talking to me through it. I did not have a strong relationship with Roberto to begin with, it hurt to an extent, but it was not something that I felt devastated over. She did end up telling me that she married Roberto to provide me a father figure. On my 14th birthday, Roberto tells my mother and aunt that we need to leave the house permanently. The day after my birthday, we packed up our things the same day and left. All of this happened one week before school started, I was going to start high school. It was hard for the first few months, and around that time I started to get more curious about my birthfather as Roberto was separating himself from the picture. So I began to research him, ask my mother (always backfires on me), and listening to family gossip. One of the few things I caught was that my mother came into the U.S. legally, unknowingly pregnant. When she began to go see the doctors for a check-up, that is when she found out she was pregnant. Got married to my step-father, Roberto, when I was 2yrs, and from there I believed he was my father all along up until I asked her. On April 20th, 2017 I received a random friend request on Facebook. The last name was exactly like my last name and strangely enough, looking at this guy's profile picture, he looked a lot like me -- strange. It took me a few days of speculation to finally grow the balls to accept the friend request after 6 days, April 25th. ""May I ask who you are? And do you have any relationship to Alexander?"" ""I am his son. From what I see, you're my sister."" From there he asked for my phone number. I was still skeptical and asked for details such as my birthfather's birthday and my mother's name to prove it. Once it was proven, I gave him me information. I found out I had a little brother in Cuba, he turned just 19 this year in January. My birthfather and his family were in Cuba. My brother 3½ yrs younger than me. It is absolutely crazy thinking how I was raised as an only child, while he was raised knowing I existed somewhere in the world. I still have trouble wrapping my head around this. I video chatted with my birthfather, Alexander, and brother, Lazaro, for hours. My father was crying. I did not get the full details on HOW they found me, it was hard to understand -- the Internet connection was extremely bad and it costs a lot of money to communicate from Cuba to the United States. I saw my grandparents for the first time. My grandfather was crying on the webcam and my grandmother was crying as well. They looked so happy and kept telling me that they prayed to God every day to just see me and that I was happy/healthy. We all laughed, we cried, we smiled. It was bittersweet. We asking questions and answering them through smiles, tears, and laughter. Unfortunately, a lot of time has passed, and that would be the first and only time I would have seen my grandmother. She died unexpectedly on December 24th, 2017. (R.I.P."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Sadness is the only thing getting me through my day I'm not really sure where to talk about this because the people in my life don't really understand. I feel like I messed up a lot of my life and the track it was going on. Now I'm just very disappointed and sad with myself. I've tried pills and therapy.

"Post: ""I used to be you"" ""It gets better"" ""You have to love yourself first"" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but.. To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you. You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you. You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you. I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost. I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously. You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them. You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless. Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses deep emotional pain, hopelessness, and a sense of isolation. The poster rejects the idea that things will get better, emphasizing that they are not like those who have found happiness and love.

"Post: Drug addict friend!!? I have had this best friend for over 8 years now. We were childhood friends and basically grew up together. The past 2 years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school. Later on he started to dabble into drugs and the “party life”. Once he started doing that, I kind of distanced myself because I didn’t know how to react. I was kind of mad but also sad so I didn’t really talk to him as much. Fast forward to now, I talk to him more but I don’t know if it will ever be the same. He is always talking about trying new drugs and doing all this stuff at parties which tbh I don’t really care for. Should I still attempt to have that relationship we once had? I still care for him but it’s so hard to listen and be there for him when he’s putting himself in dangerous situations.

"Post: Does anyone else straight up hate themselves? This more than anything reflects onto my own low self-worth, confidence and general view of modern day life. I really struggle seeing the positive in anything. I'm well aware this turns people away from me but even so, it's very difficult to break out of. I can't find the same lust for life that others seem to have. Everything to me basically comes down to: ""Meh, what's the point.""

"Post: How do I reconcile with a failed friendship from the past Earlier this year, I met a Colombian woman in my state and failed at my attempts to date her; many of our disagreements surrounded my personal history of morbid obesity. Although I am 5'9'' and now weight around 240 lbs, I have weighed nearly 400 lbs as a teenager and young adult. We dined together and talked to each other for around two weeks. Within that timeframe, I became very disaffected by her constant criticisms of other men she dated, such as her issues with their hygiene, lack of direction, etc. After talking to her nearly everyday, she suddenly asked me ""Do you think we're dating?... I think we can only be friends."" I immediately parted ways with her, informed her of my thoughts on her demanding and emotionally draining ways, very bluntly told her that I didn't like her, and directed her to no longer communicate with me. After another two weeks, she texted me out of the blue and said she ""understood"" my anger, asked to reconnect saying that she though I was a ""beautiful"" person, and eventually informed me that her ""biggest concern was my weight."" After another month, we went out (with me spending money for gas, etc.) and explored multiple regions in my state. She kept encouraging me to lose weight and gave me a diet book. Within the last times we spoke, she confided in me that she was an undocumented immigrant and told me - in anguished tears - about a failed marriage here in the U.S., as well as unwanted sexual encounters she faced here. I offered my help, but she declined any of my attempts to reconcile her immigration status. After another week, I became very depressed about not meeting specific weight targets. I eventually broke down, said I felt ""less than human,"" and asked if we could postpone any further in-person meetings until I could lose enough weight. Over the weekend, she ignored my texts; I drove to her home to see if she was okay and noticed her car was parked outside. She eventually texted me, saying that I was a person with ""unfriendly attitudes"" sometimes. Later in the day, she told me that hearing me talk of my weight was tiring. I was so baffled I couldn't get out a response. After that, she told me that I am ""too sensitive,"" looked at the criticism as an insult, and then mockingly told me ""everything hurts you, everything affects you."" I told her that ignoring me was inherently wrong and hung up. She then gave me a long text ending that I should ""just be happy... happiness isn't just about body image."" I need advice on how to handle situations like this. My gut reaction was to tell her she was a ""selfish bitch"" and hang up the phone. Looking back, that's probably what I needed to do, because that's exactly what I was thinking at the time. Secondly, I need to really reevaluate a relationship with a therapist who told me that cutting her off the first time I did was the wrong thing to do. I am holding a serious grudge against him, particularly as I don't trust him anymore. In sum, I am unhappy in life - because of shit like this. I try to be a good person and deal with human turds. But I need to be strong enough to break out of it rather than be a victim."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

I’m your older half sister, your (our) father X was married to my mum, before he met yours, and they had me in 1992 before they then got divorced. I’ve always known about you, and your brother and sisters, and I hope he told you about me too. If not I know this will be a big shock and the last thing I want to do is cause any harm.

"Post: My grandma is dying and life doesn't stop So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I'm busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay. But my grandma's dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and can't do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom's side of the family have been the only stable family I've ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class. She raised 7 amazing children (all college grads and successful in their fields) and has 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. She's 90 and has lived an amazing life. It's still so hard to say goodbye. I've been doing my best to spend time with her and my visiting family but the grief and depression are kicking my ass. I can't do anything. I have a huge paper due this week and work has been insanely stressful. I can't even manage to get my laundry done and I'm buying and eating shit food that is bankrupting me. I don't know what to do. Life won't stop, and I'm so stressed that my whole body is breaking out in rashes and I'm sore all the time.

"Post: I feel like I'm lazy I feel like I'm lazy because I have no will, desire, or energy to work. Sometimes I don't even want to walk.. and I'm tired pretty much always. It's a work out to even brush my hair. I'm physically fit, young, and given special treatment because I'm society's fit of attractive. I can't keep a job because I simply can't force my brain to do the work or I have to miss because I'm sick.. which really is just anxiety I'm sure. No one understands that I care about how lazy I seem and that it's just that I'm so tired and every thing sounds awful other than just sitting some days. I feel like I'm crazy. It just makes everything worse too. More financial problems. More people who don't understand. Substance abuse to numb. How do you guys get energy? I've started Zoloft and it's changed my life, really improving my ability to deal and not feel hopeless, but my motivation is still completely zero and I can't make myself do or care about anything.

"Post: Why is it so hard to just be empathetic? Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says ""Better luck next time,"" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her. All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter. This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for ""normal"" people? Oh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a deep sense of emotional distress and frustration. The poster expresses disappointment in their baking failure and the lack of empathy and understanding from their mother.

"Post: Women ignore me, even here, they think I'm unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love? I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I'm undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/TRWg3 So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I'm ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That's how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you ""you're ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone""? That's the life I might as well live in. Let's not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply? The sidebar says ""A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression."" and yet people make fun of me, don't want to help, and call me ugly. I guess I'm that hopeless. Am I really a human anymore? It's human to fall in love and get into relationships and have sex and whatnot with your SO. It's human to even hookup with people. I'm not qualified to be a human apparently. I bet most people my age have had 3-4 SOs, and I've had a big fat 0. Even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships, when other people see them, their mental illness makes them want to care for them, but for me, they run away. It's apparent in this subreddit too. Not even worthy of being spoken to from a woman."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a profound sense of emotional distress and despair. The poster expresses feelings of being ignored, unworthy, and undeserving of love. They provide statistics from their own experience to support their belief that they are unattractive and unwanted.

"Post: Family Problems - kicked out now moving out Issue: I have found myself unable to speak to my parents about anything. I have found, when I have problems, thinking of doing something new like get a job, am sick or just news about school or just talk want to talk about everday things that I go to speak to other family members, friends, or counselors before them who I felt more comfortable with, which would then get my parents irritated, and upset and make me even less likely to talk to them about anything because of how they reacted to me. This has been going on for years Except now it has gotten a lot worse. When I have important things to tell them about, such as news about school ( be it grades, tuition, classes etc ) appointments, invitations to a friend's wedding, or pretty much anything of that sort, I leave it to the last minute. Even thinking about telling them anything makes me feel extremely nervous - my heart speeds up and there's a pressure in my chest, I tremble, get headaches . As soon as I do talk to them I panic and change the topic to ask about something else, zone out , or I can't speak clearly at all. Because of my inability to tell them anything or even socialize with them has caused us to drift far apart. I am usually one to talk and My parents dont strike up conversation with and if I somehow must up the courage to do so I feel like they don't hear me and are quick to talk of all my shortcoming. ( My mom often talk about me negatively to her friends and y other relatives sometimes where I can hear) Anyways It doesn't go well. If they start the conversation it on a bad note . I have then avoided my family even more because of how they make me feel. I merely come home from school , do my chores and homework and staying in my bedroom ad stay out of their way. I have to admit I am not a perfect child, I have given my share of attitude etc. But I believe that most of it was because I am couldn't express how I felt or wanted to say or what I was thinking and wanted to expected them to know. While I don't drugs or curse, stay out late, outright disobey the. Etc acting this is considered disrespectful to them. At first,I just assumed it was a teenage phase a little bit worse than normal but I guess normal has been ruled out since I spend longs time in the bathroom to avoid them, hiding behind doors, flinching when I am talked to or even walking around different parts of the house to pretend I am doing something among other things . I don't know why I am like this. Or how I got like this( well maybe I have some idea) but I can't shake it. I have been advised to 'just go talk to them' but that is the very thing I cannot do! I don't think they understand how much pain this causes me when I have to gather my courage to even speak to them to ask for advice, and they rebuff me even now. I need some advice about how to proceed and handle this I have no more courage in me, low self esteem and probably some other things. I feel that my parents are not emotionally ..um supportive or open.. are so judgmental and critical I just can't. I've become isolating towards friends, restless at night and start eating all the time or not much at all. There are a few events that I think really hurt me and thus contributed to the problem overtime. examples: (Younger) they threaten to bring to boarding school and my mom even brings me to tell police station to proceed with the plan. - memorable beating from incident - memorable punishment of not letting me eat for a few days because I refuse to eat a seasme seed bun ( had sensitivity too, found out after) - memorable punishment mom knnew I was extremely afriad of the dark made me sit in the dark in the living roomfor hours of the night. - I was also left at home frequently ( with no cable , no internet) and missed out on many holiday events with family and outings. I cried a lot at first but overtime I learned to occupy myself with my own company. My mom would also leave me to clean the house as well. - little ""treasured"" things like cool pencils or little toys would be taken away.i don't know why but I never asked for them back, even afterwards nor would they give them back to me. (older) - Running away to school placement - struggling to secure financial assistance from my parents to help pay for my tuition. Scared the I have to drop out. -threatening to donate all my work earnings - and kicking me out of the house with no belongings. I have been torn between leaving and staying. Especially again with being cut off from my siblings as my stepdad prevent me from interacting with them after that. I finally left after a fight with my mom last week ( which included a rule on two day noticed before going anywhere... and talk to a worker about ending my life , which resulted her call the house concerned for my safety. Mom didnt take it very well and kicked me out) I have left and i'm trying work things out with myself and try to get better which is something I cannot do at home.

"Post: I should be an actor... I feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I don't think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though. I really want him to get help because I see myself in him, and he is a really good person who doesn't deserve to be sad.

"Post: I am stressed After doing a bit of research I found out that i matched the symptoms for stress. The symptoms I experience include, but are not (at all) limited to: Emotional instability (It has not taken much to get me over the edge). Distancing myself from others. Low self-esteem. Frequent headaches. Low energy. Insomnia. Irregular eating patterns. Frequent colds and infections (within the last 30 days I've gotten 4 separate infections.

"Post: Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!! I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can: Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me. I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming?

"Post: Grandmother asks for loan to estranged father, then refuses to carry debt I'm mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder, lives as a squatter in the forest, and works only part-time. Meanwhile, I work in Silicon Valley. His sister made a huge effort to contact me, which I ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well. Eventually, I relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays. In February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment. Meanwhile, my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for $60,000 and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if I was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes. This isn't realistic, if I did go there I would fly rather than drive for 8 hours. I called her back and asked if she would assume her son's debt. This saves me the stress of servicing the loan and I have no interest in lending money whatsoever. Since she has cash from selling her house, she is easily able to do this now. Her son can pay her back. She told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she's ""on social security."" I responded, ""I'm saving for retirement too."" (I make the full $18,500 401(k) contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably won't even exist when I am 67) ""That's no way to talk to your grandmother. I'm going to hang up if you..."" at which point I hung-up the phone. My instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three: dad, grandmother, and the aunt (who I should have just ignored). Any thoughts?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there may be some underlying emotional distress and frustration expressed in the post, such as estrangement from family members and a sense of being taken advantage of, it does not display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post seems more focused on seeking advice and opinions on how to handle the situation rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: I want to be unloved so I can die without any attachments I like to drive people away. I try to be rude to my family. I get too anxious to keep up positive relationships with others, I'd rather be alone so when the time comes when I want to kill myself, I won't be held down, and I won't have anyone tying me to this world. It's hard though. It hurts me to push people away. But it's for the best. I wish I had no attachments. I wish I had no family or friends to try to connect with, I don't want them to be sad when I die. My ultimate goal in life since I was 13 was to die in peace without any attachments to the world, or leaving enough money for my family. They shouldn't have to waste their care and time on someone like me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a desire to be unloved and to push people away, indicating low self-esteem, feelings of unworthiness, and a desire to isolate oneself. They also mention feeling too anxious to maintain positive relationships, suggesting social anxiety or a fear of getting close to others. The mention of wanting to die without any attachments and not wanting their family or friends to be sad when they die indicates a significant level of emotional distress and a preoccupation with thoughts of death. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-blame, and a belief that their loved ones would be better off without them is consistent with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Happy birthday! Anyone else hate being sung happy birthday? it feels almost sarcastic at this point. I know i should appreciate that i have people in my life that want to celebrate that kind of thing, but wearing a obviously fake smile to attempt to hide how messed up i feel inside get's very tiring, very quickly."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a dislike for being sung happy birthday and describes feeling that it is almost sarcastic. The poster acknowledges that they should appreciate having people who want to celebrate, but also mentions feeling messed up inside. This suggests a conflict between the external expectation of being happy on their birthday and their internal emotional state. The phrase ""wearing a obviously fake smile to attempt to hide how messed up i feel inside get's very tiring"" indicates a disconnect between their internal feelings and the mask they feel they have to wear. This internal struggle and feeling of being worn out aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: How should i deal with angry best friend Hi guys so basically in the past year ever since I started dating a boy (he was my best friend for the most part in high school) my current best friend (a girl in my friendship group also from highshcool) and i have gotten into many fights . These fights are mainly about her arguing that she is no longer my number one priority and that she is just second priority to my boyfriend . I do not think this is true and they are both important to me but In very different ways - he in a romantic way and she in a friendship way. She recently came back from overseas and I organised to meet up with her and we did. I never heard from her initiating a meet up for the next few weeks or so but I finally did initiate a catch up with her after hearing nothing from her for weeks. however this plan fell through because I ended up having a work shift. Yesterday my best friend had invited me to catch up with her before she went to work (she had work at 1pm)and I messaged her asking if we could hang out until 12pm. She asked me why I couldn’t stay until 1 with her till she had to go to work and I explained it’s bevause I had invited my boyfriend over for lunch and movies at my house (this catch up with my boyfriend was meant to be another day but got postponed to the same day as my catchup with my best friend due to him getting sick). She got very angry and told me she now does not want to see me at all and cancelled the catchup because she said she felt second priority. She said She shouldn’t have to change her plans for my boyfriend who I see so much more compared to her (I would love to see her more but she never plans anything with me or when I do ask her when she’s free she always has family plans ?) She also brought up the previous weeks events of me cancelling our plans due to me having work and got angry with me for never trying to find another day to make up for these cancelled plans I tried explaining to her how important she is to me and how I don’t see her as second priority or never meant to make her feel like second priority but she is giving me silent treatment or being passive aggressive . I am tired of having to prove to her that she is important to me and I am tired of this drama . My boyfriend is so wonderful and he is always there for me and replies to me instantly and we share many things on a personal level (emotionally physically etc) so to me it seems natural that I will try and adjust my plans to try and accommodate him - as he does so much for me that nobody else does, not even my best friend. so I don’t understand why she expects to be higher in priority than my bf and isn’t happy with being the same priority as him? I am tired and confused. Don’t know how to respond to her passive and blunt messages to me after I tried apologising and explaining Please help"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not display strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there may be some frustration, confusion, and exhaustion expressed in the post, it primarily focuses on a specific issue with the poster's best friend and seeking advice on how to handle the situation. The emotional distress seems to stem more from the conflict with the friend rather than a deep sense of hopelessness or despair. The post does not exhibit the profound emotional pain, lack of enjoyment, or overwhelming exhaustion commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I really need some advice *trigger warning* *trigger warning* Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this. I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend. To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family. Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they didn't? I would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier. Thank you. tl;dr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I'm going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do), that might at least show her that things can get better."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a deep concern for the well-being of the poster's 12-year-old cousin who is experiencing depression. The poster acknowledges the complexity of depression and asks for advice on how to support their cousin during their visit. The mention of self-harm, wanting to die, and the description of a difficult home environment all indicate a high level of emotional distress. The poster's expressed desire to show their cousin that things can get better suggests a sense of hopelessness and a need for guidance and support. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

"Post: I just drove 1000 miles cause my Gma tried to OD and is in ICU. IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I've always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything. No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she's a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.... These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but didn't see the signs. Now we surprised her and didn't tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell wasn't the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister doesn't even know, she just thinks she's 'sick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still doesn't help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I don't know how I'm coping. It hasn't hit me yet I think... Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she's the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She's his guide and he'd be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150'd and I've talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she didn't get the support she needed from me. It breaks my soul to think that this loving amazing person would want it to go all away and leave all of us behind. I have so many cherished memories of my grandparents.

"Post: A letter to … my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write... Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes. Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldn’t wake you up. You wouldn’t wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didn’t even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldn’t get cold. But I don’t think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldn’t really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse? You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I don’t know. No one can say it didn’t take a toll on all of us. You probably don’t remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: “I failed at life.” So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I’m telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand. Even as I am writing this, I don’t know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesn’t matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I couldn’t tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success. I wish you all the happiness you deserve. Love you, babe. Your sister"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression.

"Post: Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy. During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of 40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"". I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide. And addressing the ""3 months"" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days. I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fiancée who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey.

"Post: I had a date on Saturday. It went great unfortunately. I have a friend that I'll call H. I've known her for 2+ years now and I really like her as a person. I recently discovered that she was interested in dating me, which boosted my self confidence so much (because who would be into someone like me). Well a week ago I worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, and this Saturday we went on one. It was great. We went to a small local coffee shop and sat there and just talked for almost 3 hours. It was seriously such a good time. On the way out I asked if she'd like to do it again and she said yes. Awesome! Later that night I get a text... she doesn't think it will work out in the long run. I ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future, she's still getting over another break up, etc... Well that sucks, but I understand. I was texting H about it a bit more tonight and this is what I get in reply to how I feel about the whole situation- ""i feel like there were so many expectations from others that it was made into something i thought i wanted, but then i realized it wasn’t."" That attraction she had to me? It wasn't real. It was all made up because of her friends. And of course it was, because who would be into someone like me? It hurts so bad. I'm crying while typing this. I feel like such an idiot for believing someone would actually be attracted to me. I'm a fool for believing it and I hate myself for it. I don't know what to do.

"Post: Had a good dream, then I woke up Last night I had a really good dream. The type of dream that makes you think “fuck it, maybe I won’t kill myself.” I was with someone, probably an s/o, and there wasn’t anything going on but everything was at peace. Then my grandmother woke me up for a breakfast that everyone argued over, even with a goddamn three year old. Nothing changed, I just had a bullshit dream that’ll never really happen.

"Post: I feel like if anyone got to really know me they'd find out I'm weird and awkward and they'd stop wanting to be around me. I'm terrified of getting close to people, but I want friends, so I keep doing this dance back and forth of trying to hang out with people then cutting contact before becoming friends. As far back as I can remember, whenever I've tried to join a group conversation I've gotten weird looks, or people not understanding what I'm saying. I've learned that the less I say, the less awkward people will be around me, and I hate it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Abusive dad or I'm just toxic... Two weeks ago, my dad lost our dog. It went to the shelter but due to the microchip ownership issue, we have to wait two weeks to get her. I told my family that there's a chance that we might not get the dog back. My dad then started saying how it's fate that the dog is gone and that if we can't get it back then it's destiny. I got annoyed and said ""But really, it's because you weren't being careful and you left her at the park"". He then started yelling at me. Saying he's the only one who walks the dog. I then said I walk the dogs as well, I just don't do it enough because I'm the only one in the family who works from morning to night, paying for the bills, groceries and everything. He then claimed that it's not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it, would it be his fault. I responded with yes, it is your fault because it's under your duty of care. Anyway, things got ugly from there. I didn't speak to him for a week. He got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines. I paid for the $500 one today this morning. Then he asked to borrow my car, and I lent it to him. After that, he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog. e.g. ""Bailey, you're lucky that I'm here. If i wasn't here, you would've died a long time ago. Some people just know how to talk and don't do shit."" I got annoyed and said you lost the dog. Get over it. He then yelled at me. I got annoyed and told him to fuck off. He then started saying ""wow, you're being so disrespectful. God will punish you. I wish you die and I wish you'll live out your life alone."" I then said ""You came home and started a fight for no reason. Don't play the victim when I argue back"". He then said ""I'm just talking to myself. You don't have to listen to me."" I then said ""Go talk to the wall then."" I shut the door and continue with my business. He then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how I'll die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me. I then angrily snapped at him saying ""I may or may not die before you, but I can bet that if you die, no one in this fucking world would mourn for you"". I then shut the door, and I didn't hear anything from him again. Not sure if I have a abusive father or I'm just toxic or maybe it's both. I don't want to live like this anymore."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays a significant level of conflict and dysfunction within the family, particularly between the poster and their father. The individual describes their father yelling, making offensive remarks, and even wishing death upon them. Their responses indicate a level of anger and frustration, but may be seen as reactive rather than a deep sense of hopelessness or despair commonly associated with very severe depression. While the situation described is distressing and unhealthy, the emotional indicators do not align strongly with symptoms of depression."
"Post: My mother pt.2 I posted about my issues with my mother the other day, and I have discovered new information. She's been complaining to her boyfriend, and he has a busy mouth, so naturally he's spilled it all. I've learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after I lost my apartment, and she's been saying she buys me lots of things: clothes, computers, etc. And I just toss them aside and never use them, because I'm an ungrateful child. So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What's probably going on here is that she's buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she's just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she's stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment. Because I can't live with knowing that he's growing up in the same toxicity that I did, and how it'll fuck him up like it did me. She's two-facing everyone; talking shit to one person, then smiling to the person's face she just trashed. And if anyone tries to call her out, she gets pissed and plays dumb. Her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house. She does drugs on the daily. She's going to end up old, a lone, and with her kids and family hating her, no one coming to see her. I'm ready to disown her. It just hurts. Why is she like this? Why does it have to be this way? It hurts."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys deep emotional pain, hurt, and a sense of hopelessness. The poster describes their mother's behavior, including manipulation, deceit, and drug abuse. They express feeling hurt, betrayed, and desperate to protect their younger brother from growing up in a toxic environment. The mention of wanting to disown their mother and the repeated emphasis on the pain and hurt they experience suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of despair, questioning, and the feeling of being trapped in a difficult situation indicate a strong likelihood of depression."
"Post: I’m 2-3 years I’ll be moving to a state where purchasing a gun is easy. I’ll finally be able to successfully commit suicide. Been through 11 electroconvulsive therapy procedures (shock therapy), so many medications didn’t work, my psychiatrist and therapist gave up on me. I’m exactly what you think I am, a fucking loser. A kissless, hugless, ugly, worthless virgin. It’s said that the decision of suicide is an impulse, well what if I told you this “impulse decision” has been 7 years in the making. I’m 20 now and man, it’s time to take action."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reveals severe hopelessness, despair, and a strong desire to end one's life. The poster expresses a lack of support and treatment effectiveness, as well as intense self-loathing. The consistent theme of feeling worthless, ugly, and socially inadequate suggests significant self-esteem issues. The mention of electroconvulsive therapy and numerous failed medications indicates a prolonged struggle with mental health. The explicit mention of planning to purchase a gun for the purpose of suicide is a direct and alarming indication of a very severe depressive state."
"Post: Eating meals alone at college has to be one of the single worst feelings one can experience at college I feel awful right now, orientation was okay i guess, made a few acquaintances but thats it, i feel i dont really have any friends yet, i just transferred to this school, living on my own for the first time, and ive always struggled making friends, and just sitting here in the dining hall by myself just makes me want to burst into tears, maybe going away isnt and never will be for me :/, sucks how my whole life i cant seem to make friends, then finally i make 2 really good friends and i move away and im back to square one, fuck me seriously, i just cant win"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

They also reflect on their past difficulties with making friends and how it feels like starting over again after finally making two good friends. The overall tone conveys a deep sense of despair, isolation, and self-blame, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: Theres nothing In this world I want more than enjoying video games and the hype around it again," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong desire and longing for enjoyment and excitement in video games. The use of the phrase ""nothing in this world"" signifies a sense of emptiness and lack of fulfillment in other areas of life. This could be indicative of anhedonia, which is a common symptom of depression where individuals struggle to find pleasure in activities they once enjoyed. The post does not mention any specific emotional pain or distress, but the focus on the absence of enjoyment and the longing for it suggests a potential connection to depression."
"Post: Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated. Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible. I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included. They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it. Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15). I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order. I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all. Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do. I know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option, but I would rather know why they thought to give me this gift. I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays a sense of disappointment and confusion about a gift exchange with a friend. It highlights the discrepancy in the value and thoughtfulness of the gifts exchanged and raises questions about the friend's intentions and the nature of their friendship. While there is a tinge of sadness and concern, it does not exhibit the pervasive emotional distress, hopelessness, or self-deprecation commonly associated with severe depression. The focus of the post is on the specific situation and seeking advice or understanding rather than expressing a profound sense of despair or worthlessness."
"Post: Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry. I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to “rapebait” by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD. I’m better now however as this was 5 years ago. I cringe whenever I remember it however."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains multiple indicators that suggest the poster may suffer from depression. Firstly, the poster describes experiencing episodes of clinical depression followed by periods of euphoria and high energy levels, which could be indicative of a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder. These extreme fluctuations in mood can be distressing and disruptive to one's life. 

Furthermore, the poster mentions having made poor choices, acting conceited and rude without realizing it, and experiencing frequent fits of rage while taking Zoloft. These experiences suggest that the medication may have had negative effects on their mental state and behavior. The mention of attempting suicide within the first month of taking the medication is a significant and alarming sign of severe emotional distress.

The post also reveals self-destructive behaviors such as developing anorexia, making poor sexual and financial decisions, and engaging in inappropriate behavior towards children and teachers. These actions indicate a lack of impulse control and judgment, which can be associated with depression or other mental health conditions.

The poster's mention of crashing and burning after going off the medication suggests a period of worsening depression or instability. The fact that they still cringe when remembering these past events highlights the lasting impact of these experiences on their emotional well-being.

Overall, the post portrays a significant level of emotional distress, erratic behavior, and negative life consequences, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression and possibly other mood disorders."

So ignoring the pun, I seriously have no interests in what carreer I want when I'm older (im 17, kicked out of collage) I don't know if this is he depression but after working overtime on my shitty Saturday job I have had 5days work in a row and without sounding like a lazy cunt who has never worked. I genuinely have never been so fucking depressed, all I have done is wake up at 8. Work all day, not said a word to anyone been depressed all day, got in, all my mates are out enjoying summer and don't speak to me or anything. I usually get in at about 6pm I eat tea then shower then do nothing for a few hours until I go to bed and repeat. Without sounding too dramatic, I can't do this for the rest of my life. I don't want to work. I know you have to but why? I don't want to do something I don't want to do, I don't understand why the world is this way and it makes me super fucking depressed.

"Post: I want to fix my best friend and I's friendship, but I'm not sure if I should... any advice? Hi! I'll try to make this as short as possible, but you can ask me for more details if you want to. My best friend (19/f) and I (19/f) met two years ago. We're polar opposites, but we somehow became very close, and eventually started calling each other best friends (and other nicknames haha). It was awesome, and she's the only person I feel that close with -- she's like family (though I never told her that). Back in July though, I was feeling very drained. My best friend deals with severe depression and I was helping her a lot through it, willingly so. Honestly I felt fine for a year but I've been going through a huge identity crisis, trying to find myself and trying to know myself. I felt so confused and lost with myself -- I didn't know what I wanted anymore. It was bad. It was very exhausting for me mentally but I thought the cause of how I felt was my best friend. You might ask why I thought that, well, whenever we'd hang out, I'd have to go out of my house. I'm an introvert, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, I always feel uncomfortable being outside. But considering I'd only go outside to hang out with my best friend, I thought *she* was the problem. I took me a while but I eventually decided, even though I didn't really want to, to end the friendship. I thought this would make me feel better, like it was the key to my happiness or something. After I overcame the ugly crying phase that lasted for a week after I ended the friendship, I was feeling really good... for only a week. It was a sense of freedom like ""I don't have to worry about anything anymore!!"". I started missing her real bad though. But I thought, hey, maybe I just miss the IDEA of her, and not really HER. So I waited to see if my feelings would change over time. Back in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn't like me or think I'm too ""innocent"" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn't say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn't last long because I ended up ignoring everyone's messages. Fast forward to now. I still miss my best friend terribly. Some days are worse than others. I thought I'd be over it by now but I always end up crying at night because I just want to talk to her and hang out like we used to. I tried to distract myself as much as I could, and I tried to make new friends, but every time, I ended up realizing that I was just trying to find someone to replace her, which obviously didn't work out. I realized that I talk about her everyday still to my parents. My mom actually asked me how she was doing and I had to remind her that we're no longer best friends. I still think very fondly of my best friend so when I talk about her, or think about her, it's like nothing happened. I dream about her too sometimes. I want to contact her again. I want to explain to her everything I was feeling and tell her I want us to be friends again. But I'm scared. It looks like she's completely moved on from me, and she has this new (guy) friend and they seem really close. It makes me sad because I feel like I've been replaced and I won't be able to be her best friend again. I want to be here for her, laugh with her, cry with her, hang out with her, be by her side during the best and worst moments. I don't want to be with anyone else. Just her. I can't blame her for finding new friends and moving on, also her new friend seems like a really great guy, I actually think I'd get along with him. But I don't know, it still makes me feel sad. It makes me feel like I shouldn't contact her because she doesn't need me in her life anymore and she forgot about me. I'm aware this is probably the case though. I've been thinking of making an audio where I just talk about what's on my mind and talk about our friendship and send it to her. I'm so scared though. Is this a good idea or should I just drop it? It really makes me feel sad and I'm crying way too much over this -- I feel like, even if we can't be friends again, I need some closure. I didn't tell her everything when I ended the friendship, I only told her something like ""we don't click anymore"", I'm not even sure because it was a lie. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying her"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays multiple indicators of emotional distress, including feelings of confusion, isolation, shame, and sadness. The poster describes feeling drained and exhausted from supporting their best friend through severe depression, leading to a decision to end the friendship.

I’m ugly as hell, my face can be described as if Satan sneered his shit on the earth, I’m probably stupid, and everyone I know would be better off without me. The three people who actually fucking cared about me are fucking dead because of me One of my two best friends died in a car crash because he was getting me a stupid birthday gift, my other best friend killed her self because I let my guard down and wasn’t there when she needed it, and my aunt drug overdosed two weeks ago, she wouldn’t have been on them if I hadn’t put that unnecessary stress on her My grades are fucked, I’m fuckin stupid, I’m goddamn hideous, and I fuck up everything I see, I finally see why nobody fucking wants me, I’m just a fucking burden to everyone I know, and every time I attempt suicide I fuck it up cuz I’m a fucking moron... my therapy didn’t work, antidepressants made me feel worse, I guess I’m a hopeless human being.

I am doing an internship and doing 6 hours of college classes over the summer but both can be done from home and the internship is really better suited for self-starters. Once I'm out of bed, I'm good for the most part. It's just getting out of bed that is my biggest problem.

"Post: Does anyone else ""live inside their head""? Hi, this is my first ever post. I feel like I'm living in my head 99% of the time. I catch myself forming conversations in my head between me and other people. It's pretty obvious because my lips move and I tend to smile when this happens. (A couple of my friends have pointed this out) Sometimes, the conversations are just between me and myself. I feel very numb during this whole process. The topic of these ""conversations"" revolve around feeling worthless in every aspect. It feels like life is against me. I'm average in every way (looks, intelligence, skills). I feel like I will never amount to anything. I just do things to get them over with, just so that I can continue to keep to myself and get stuck in my head like this. I don't have pride in any non-school/school project or assignment I do. Even things that should be enjoyable, like going out with friends doesn't really do anything for me. It feels as if nothing brings me joy, except numbing myself out from everyone else."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains several strong indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling disconnected from reality, spending majority of their time lost in their thoughts.

"Post: Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay It's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting. Recently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends. My primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance. I don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media. Going down a rabbit hole - please help!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses concern for their friend and uncertainty about how to approach the situation, there is no mention of personal emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression such as hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, or overwhelming exhaustion. The tone of the post seems more focused on problem-solving and seeking advice rather than expressing deep emotional pain."
"Post: I was so happy last week. I spent a week with my long distance boyfriend for our anniversary. It was the happiest I'd been in weeks. I knocked a few things off my bucket list, like casinos, a septum piercing, and walking barefoot in the gulf of Mexico. I was so, so unbelievably happy. Now that I'm back home, I'm back to being just as despondent as I was before. I'm cold and distant again. I don't want to talk to anybody. I'm back at work, in a horrible job with horrible people. I don't want to talk to my mom because she doesn't get it and it feels like she can't be bothered to try. My boyfriend is amazing and supportive but I know this is putting so much strain on our relationship. I'm trying so hard but I feel so stuck. I guess you could say that I'm not doing too great."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a range of emotions that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster describes a stark contrast between being extremely happy during a recent experience with their long-distance boyfriend and feeling despondent, cold, and distant after returning home. They express a lack of desire to talk to anyone, including their mother, and feeling stuck in a horrible job with horrible people. The mention of putting strain on their relationship and expressing a lack of progress despite trying hard suggests feelings of hopelessness and frustration. These emotional indicators, coupled with the overall tone of the post, suggest a significant level of emotional distress consistent with depression."
"Post: I don't know what to do anymore. I've been with my boyfriend for almost 10 years, since we were 16. Things have generally been awesome, but the past couple of years has just consisted of a giant blow-out argument once every few weeks, generally stupid shit (me complaining of not spending enough time together, him not contributing to chores, him complaining of not enough sex) I don't know how to talk to him about our problems without him getting angry and breaking objects and me getting insanely sad and just not being able to communicate as my brain just goes ""YOU'RE USELESS! WHY HASNT HE LEFT YOU YET, USELESS FUCKING CUNT"". I just need someone to talk to or something. i dunno"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress and emotional dysregulation. The poster describes frequent arguments with their long-term boyfriend, highlighting issues like lack of time spent together, unequal division of chores, and sexual dissatisfaction. The mention of the boyfriend getting angry and breaking objects suggests a harmful and potentially abusive dynamic. The poster also expresses intense self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness, using derogatory language towards themselves. The desperation for someone to talk to and the overall tone of hopelessness and despair align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others. TL;DR: I have a bad personality and I want to find a new one that is better.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of self-criticism, low self-esteem, and a strong desire for change. The poster describes their personality as a result of childhood abuse and depression, indicating underlying emotional distress. They express a pattern of people-pleasing behavior to the detriment of their own well-being and a desire to break free from it. The mention of feeling like a piece of shit, setting high standards, and blaming others suggests a negative and self-deprecating thought pattern commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of the post is one of frustration, self-doubt, and a strong desire for personal growth, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: I Could Use Some Support Right Now Yesterday my best friend of five years attempted to kill their self. I'm currently being blown away by school (grad school if it really matters). I don't know what to think at all. This is midterm week and most my profs are understanding but the one class I'm worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark I get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but I need the feedback to decide if I'm going to even stay in the course because it's incredibly difficult. It just feels like nothing is going my way currently and it's so hard to study or focus. side note; another prof let me write as told them (like I did the other) that I wanted it as a distraction and said that if I did bad they'd shift the weight to my final.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses multiple emotional concerns and difficulties that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed by their best friend's suicide attempt, which suggests a deep level of emotional distress.

"Post: Lonely, family/friends just not interested?? We moved across the country almost a year ago. We left all our extended family behind, which was hard because we were really close to them. But, It was a great opportunity for us. We are doing really well as a family unit, with life, jobs, and everything other than missing our family. Now, I'm getting really lonely, and can't seem to get any of my in laws or friends to come visit, even the ones with no jobs, kids, whatever. Tried offering to pay for the airfare. I set up a fully furnished guest room, and offered it up. I have kept in touch with everyone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis on the phone this whole time, as well as every couple of days on social media. We were all so close before, but since we moved, it feels like everyone just wants to forget we existed. Is it time to just stop trying?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of loneliness and a sense of abandonment from family and friends. The poster describes the effort they have made to maintain contact and invite others to visit, but it seems to be met with indifference. These emotions can be indicative of depression, as feelings of isolation and a lack of social support are often associated with the condition. However, the post does not exhibit symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, such as extreme hopelessness or a lack of enjoyment in activities. The post seems to be seeking advice and validation rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Therefore, the label for this post would be ""No."""
"Post: How to Make Friends When No One Likes You A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself. That obviously left a lot of scars, and my depression (diagnosed in 7th grade) makes me isolate myself a lot. I don't want to sound like I'm looking for sympathy, and sorry if I am. But now I have mere months left in the school year of my senior year and I still have absolutely no friends. I am friendly and I try to be as outgoing as I can, it feels like everyone is keeping me at an arm's distance though. Is it me? It must be, I don't know why but something about me just makes others hate me. I'll ask how someone's day is going and often the reply is just a short ""pretty good"" and then that's it. I refuse to beg for friendship or to force anyone to talk to me so when they walk away or leave I'll just accept it, wave and say ""see ya around"" or etc. How do I get people to be my friend though? I don't smell, I am ugly but I try to cover that up best I can with makeup. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere with someone."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post contains clear indicators of emotional distress and negative self-perception. The poster describes being bullied in the past, which has left scars and contributed to a sense of isolation. They express feelings of loneliness and a desire to make friends but feel that everyone keeps them at a distance. The repeated questioning of whether it is their fault and feeling that something about them makes others hate them indicates low self-esteem and self-blame, which are often associated with depression. The post also conveys a strong desire for connection and a sense of belonging, further highlighting the emotional distress and social difficulties experienced by the poster."
"Post: seeing other people having close, intimate relationships with each other made me so goddamn sad that I had to leave. I was at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friends and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left. I can only really think of one close friend that I have, and even then we don’t really hang out that often. I don’t really have anyone in my life."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a sense of sadness and longing, as well as feelings of isolation and difficulty forming close relationships. The poster expresses feeling overwhelmed by seeing others have close relationships and highlights their own struggle with mental illness and fear of rejection as barriers to forming connections.

Post: Has anyone tried Trintellix/Brintellix? How long does the initial insomnia take to go away? I just started the drug and I slept terribly the first two nights. How long does it take for this side effect to subside?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a concern regarding the side effect of insomnia associated with taking Trintellix/Brintellix. Although the tone is not explicitly emotional, the mention of struggling with sleep and inquiring about how long the side effect might last indicates a level of distress or discomfort.

"Post: Describe your depression Here is how I would describe mine: I live an exceptionally fortunate life. I am a college student interning for a commercial real estate development company. I had two internships last summer, one in venture capitalism and one teaching middle schoolers how to code. I have a potential internship lined up for a Fortune 500 company in Miami next summer and potentially an private equity internship lined up. I have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful. But I feel so unhappy and miserable with my life. My thoughts are so irrational and negative that I can't see how fortunate I am to have all that I have. I make great money with my summer internship, more money then most adults make, but none of that matters, because I still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday. I feel hopeless all day, everyday. I feel unloved and unwanted. Even though I have more than enough to be grateful for, I still feel inferior and lower than the lowest of the low."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a clear sense of unhappiness, misery, and hopelessness despite having external indicators of success such as internships, money, and connections.

These emotions and thoughts align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: IDK WHAT TO DO ANYMORE AH IM IN SUCH A DILEMMA. Basically I have this friend whom I’ve known for 10+ years and we’ve always been quite different but were good friends nonetheless. Over the past 3 years this friends true colours have been slowly creeping out and its been really affecting me! Most recently she did some that was way out of line and really made me question who she is!

She’s basically just so fake around me and is so nice to everyone else and I ignore it and let it slide but the thing she did that was way out of line is something I can’t get over?

And now that she’s joining this club it’s gonna make things 1000x worse because she’s just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because she’s known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep? I’ve tried confronting her about her actions but she just laughs it off??? How can I just get over it all ready?? It’s really beginning to affect my mental health 😭 like I didn’t really speak either her over the last 2 months and I’ve never been happier but seeing her around college more literally makes my blood boil she’s honestly just so toxic and I feel like hanging with her in this club is going to ruin my reputation and what others think of me!

"Post: I get angrier while running When my depression flares up (mostly in the winter), I get what I call 'the angrys'. As the run gets more intense, I start thinking the darkest, angry thoughts like a swarm of bees around my head. I hate everyone on the street and God forbid anyone get in my way. Usually running makes me feel good and it does later on but during the run, wow."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster experiences depression flare-ups, specifically during the winter. They describe feeling anger and ""the angrys"" while running, with their thoughts becoming dark and angry.

"Post: Not good enough. Greetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I've come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here's the scoop: Growing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won't say which, because I'm a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the ""larger"" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more ""attractive"" one. The more ""successful"" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the ""nicer"" one. That hasn't mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-""better"" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I've considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don't believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I'm struggling. Bad. I'm basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don't think I'll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling not good enough and expresses deep pain and self-loathing. They share experiences of being constantly compared to a relative and feeling overshadowed and unattractive. The mention of considering cutting ties with their entire family and feeling like their wellbeing is not a priority suggests a significant level of emotional distress and hopelessness. The overall tone of the post conveys a profound sense of despair and a struggle with self-worth, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
Post: Inducing a natural coma This is a very serious question.Id like to induce a coma of at least 3 months on myself. People who are giving me the ‘not possible’ or ‘only medically induced’ answer. Tks but no tks.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a desire to induce a coma, which is a highly distressing and extreme measure to find relief from emotional pain. This suggests a profound level of emotional distress and desperation.

"Post: Trying to start a dialogue with a friend and seeing it blow up in my face Hi Everyone, First off, thank you to everyone here. I've been a long time reader but never posted. This is yet another post regarding a friend and the problems associated. Basically, me and this guy have been friends since college, we're both in our mid-30s and entering into the next phase of our respective lives. We've always had a contentious friendship, many fights, many core disagreements, and often general dislike for one another. The solution to dealing with this has always been along the line of this: it's R, and he's an asshole, so what can you expect! So the story in question goes like this... we're at a mutual friends wedding and he goes out of his way to ignore me and my gf, now my fiance, coming over to the group we were with and asking a question to a couple people then leaving, also practically walking by us without saying hi. It was only until I said something that he acknowledged us, which set my fiance up in flames. A few weeks later we got engaged and I texted all my friends, including R, individually with a semi copied/pasted message. It was short and sweet, but 100% honest. He doesn't reply, I left the country for vacation, and I never got his text. Turns out he did reply but more on that in a minute. I was upset, I sent him an email that was part deconstructive to our friendship, partly selfish, but also completely honest. I told him my feelings, how I contemplated why he didn't respond but ultimately decided that i didn't care and that I didn't need someone in my life who was going to treat me that way. By telling him these were my feelings and repeating that I wanted him to realize I was upset and I wanted to open a discussion. I never said directly ""I don't want you as a friend"" or ""you're not invited to my wedding"" but that is what he took from it. I wanted to open a dialogue, but he got really upset and angry. Also turns out he did respond to my text, a week later and said that the original text never sent, but that since his wife is pregnant he wouldn't be able to make the wedding, which is completely fine with me because the wedding is in another country. I just hated his response, it was cold and not something a friend should send to another friend regarding a wedding. I called him out and wanted to make him see that by my standards he was not acting like a friend, but also neither was I. I had not put much effort into the friendship either. But I did say that I wanted to say these things rather than say nothing with the hopes that we could find common ground and build a foundation for something to grow in the future, which he completely ignored. I honestly have no idea what to do. I fear he is going to turn all our mutual friends against me, and I don't know how I am able to handle that, or if I can even handle that. My life is in a great place, but my friendships are shit, and that hurts more than I could ever imagine. To put more on top of it, his wife was having issues with a pregnancy, which he said were serious. But I heard from a mutual friend that he said she was fine. So I don't know how to react to that. I honestly don't know where to go from here. My fiance, my rock, my saving grace, is unfortunately traveling for work this month and really crazy busy. She owns her own business so it's important for her to pound the pavement and get sales, so I really don't want her to be burdened by my own bullshit. I can send anyone the email discussion in a PDF if you want to read it. Hopefully someone can help."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does exhibit some emotional distress and challenges in the poster's friendship. They express feeling hurt, upset, and unsure about how to handle the situation. There is also a mention of their friendships being ""shit"" and it hurting more than they could imagine. However, the post does not convey a deep sense of hopelessness, despair, or lack of fulfillment that is commonly associated with very severe depression.

"Post: Loneliness is just so crippling I just can't handle it myself, and there's no one I can realistically ask for help because I just need so much more help than anyone can give. And I don't have nearly enough people to spread out the burden. I just don't seem capable of finding anyone who actually wants to be a real friend to me. I just feel so incredibly sad because I feel alone and I can't do anything about it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness and emotional distress.

"Post: Gossiping in the family Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, ""I did nothing, we said nothing."" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It's also wrong to play the same game. What should I do? I really am at a loss."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Ever Feel FB ""Friends"" Are Lying Out Their Asses? For real. How the fuck can people post about life being great, life is so good, and being blessed?

"Post: Post-Graduation Depression I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months I’ve grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. What’s shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area. My life is comparatively so much better, but I feel this knot in my stomach as if I just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now I’m finally seeing how much of myself I’ve given up to get to where I am. Life feels devoid of adventure and I feel like I have no passion left. I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but it’s weird to have it catch up with me at the point in my life where past sacrifices were meant to mitigate it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Friend emotionally unloads on me? I have a particular friend from highschool who always wants to meet up with me. We were good friends then purely due to convenience I feel, and over time we’ve become really different people. She had a bout of depression and has been struggling with these issues for several years now. I don’t feel like she’s responded to my own issues well, and for some reason her method of reassuring me is to “move on, and get over it”. I’m not quite sure how I feel about that considering I would never say that to her. It’s gotten to the point where she would occasionally send me messages on Facebook about her ill mental health and says that I am the only one she can talk to about this, despite having a boyfriend and other friends already. I want to cut her off, but at the same time for some reason I feel guilty to? Like here’s an emotionally vulnerable person and I’m not sure if I’m just adding to her despair.

"Post: Are friendship ultimatums a good or bad thing? I have this friend who've I've been friends with for about 7 years. She moved across the country and is depressed for not knowing anyone she can be friends with. She's been making me feel bad about not going there to visit her. I've told her several times, I'm broke and have school obligations. Every time we talk, she brings up how she misses me and just needs a hug, and have someone (me) brush her hair, and hang out with her. Recently, I've found out that she feels there's an inequity in our friendship over the past year; because I haven't gone to visit her. I personally feel I've been there for her and her child whenever she needed me and dropped everything and go see her whenever her and her ex-husband and ex-best friend would have a fight. About two months ago, my S.O. made a bad joke and she ended up lashing out on him and making a comment about a subject that I told her in confidence, and ended up hurting me as a result. We talked about it, and tried to go back to normal. But, I realized, that I'm still hurt by her comment and told her that. She then says she's going through a lot right now and can't deal with me going back and forth on my feelings. So she said I need to ""figure my shit out"" and let her know if we can move past this or end our friendship. I've been doing some thinking and I'm torn on whether or not to try to get over this feeling of betrayal, or just completely end the friendship all together. TLDR; My friend gave me an ultimatum to decide if I still want to be friends with her or not."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

Medical data, social media data etc. So if I hadn't seen so many posts about not gonna say it I would have thought that Google can read my mind....

"Post: How do you talk about depression to your friends? I'm really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches. This shame has led to me neglecting some relationships because I don't know how to talk about this without seeming really pathetic, which makes me feel even more guilty for neglecting friends that I actually do value, but just can't bring myself to talk to. So how do you talk about this in a way that seems... I don't know - like - valid? I don't know what to say. I've been depressed and unemployed for over a year and now I have a friend calling me and I know that I should talk to them (I even *want* to talk to them - like they're awesome and I really really want them to be in my life again) but the thought of trying to explain myself - it makes me feel sick and disgusting to even contemplate.

"Post: Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression. ____________________________________ Why it IS like a skinned knee: Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!"" You feel so helpless. When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss. But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while. Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc. So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away. ______________________________________________ Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee: Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point. But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point? The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort."" Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy."" That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down. If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression. Stay safe, everyone."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a multitude of indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes episodes of depression, likening them to the pain of a skinned knee.

"Post: Losing my mind at 20! So the best label I can put is depression I don’t know if that is what I’m really going through tho long story short I grew up in a pretty bad environment had a single mother (now that I’m older I understand stand that it must of been hard being a single mom but what I was put thru is still no excuse)who was very abusive verbally and physically I remember having brooms broke across my back and head for simply spilling a drink, when I was 16 I was stabbed by mother and was taken to the hospital of course like many children who are abused I did not speak up I guess because of fear but more because I didn’t want to be looked at like a sick puppy over the years I was able to cope with my environment and it became normal the part that I don’t understand is when I was 18 I decided to leave and with no real support I was homeless for a bit I used to set daily goals for myself so I wouldn’t let depression set in like find a job,etc I bought a car with the little money I had and slept in that and went to the gym to shower strangely enough that is when I was at the most happiness I have ever felt flash a year later I’m 19 have an apartment a good job and have the whole world in front of me but I’m not happy and it’s been a year I’m 20 now and feel like I’m 60 I have no drive and think about ending my life everyday I just simply feel numb or like im not connected to body I also didn’t mention that I have siblings and I think about them all the time I think that I’m a terrible person for leaving them to live in that environment when I’m free enjoying life anytime I feel joy it’s instantly sucked from me because I began to think about my siblings and think what they are going thru right now I wonder if they love me or hate me and its been taking a toll on me physically and mentally and at this point I don’t know what to do I haven’t tried reaching out because that would mean I would have to see my mother and I’m no longer afraid of her she simply doesn’t deserve to see me at all I sometimes think when she’s on her deathbed will she ever feel any remorse for what she has done I also think when she goes to take her last breath will she wonder about me she hasn’t seen me since I left and she won’t ever again Any thoughts on what I should do?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional pain, trauma, and despair. The poster shares their history of growing up in an abusive environment, experiencing physical and verbal abuse from their mother. This trauma is further exemplified by the mention of being stabbed by their mother at the age of 16. The post also highlights the poster's struggles with homelessness and their efforts to set goals and find happiness, but ultimately feeling empty and disconnected from their body. The mention of contemplating suicide and feeling numb suggests a profound level of emotional distress consistent with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The guilt the poster feels for leaving their siblings in that environment and the toll it is taking on them both physically and mentally further support the presence of severe depression. The avoidance of reaching out due to the fear of seeing their mother shows the ongoing impact of the abuse on their well-being."
"Post: Estranged mum possibly dying Hi so I'm basically in need of some help here with a big issue from people who have possibly experienced something similar. So it's a long story and I'll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer. A brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the ""settle down type"" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren't able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we'd have to stay with her friends so she wouldn't get in trouble and others we'd have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn't get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn't win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don't you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland. I was about 10 at the time and and as such didn't want to move that's when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend's stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we'd get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn't handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks. When we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum's point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it's the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I'm definitely aware I'm no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I'm finished atleast. The next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that's from April till September if I'm remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it's all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a ""normal"" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that's it she's gone. Yet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I'd rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything ""big"" so ofcourse she didn't like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc But we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple indicators of very severe depression.

"Post: Had one of those days where I really wanted to just get out of bed and be with people: hit up my friends and no one could hang out or seemed into it. Really brought me down, man. I feel like I give a lot and don't get a whole lot in return sometimes. And part of this is probably just egocentrism. I shouldn't expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute, even though I told them I was feeling lonely. It just sucks because I feel like I would do anything for the people I care about, like I would drop anything to be there. I put those standards on other people and maybe that's wrong of me. Anyway, I just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of disappointment, loneliness, and feeling unappreciated or not valued by friends. The poster expresses a desire for social connection and reaching out to friends, but being met with rejection or disinterest. This can be indicative of feelings of low self-worth and a lack of fulfillment in relationships, which are often associated with depression.

Post: Nausea/heartburn from Wellbutrin I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now I’m avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday. I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I’m getting ready to go to bed I’m just hit with bad nausea out of no where. I avoid eating before bed as well. Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then I’m worried if there’s some 12 hour delay to it I’m just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it won’t effect my sleep.

"Post: Hearing my parents doing naughty things at night scars me. Hey guys, my name is Sally. I'm seventeen this year and it's 5am right now at where I live. I don't know how to phrase my words as my head is in a mess. To provide some background story about myself, my family live in a compact flat and as a result, I sleep with my parents. In the bedroom, my parents sleep on the bed while I sleep on a mattress beside their bed. When I had nightmares when I was younger, I would squeeze in between them and only then, could I fall asleep. As I got older, when I would replicate doing the same thing when I had nightmares, I would get scolded instead. That's how the bed was - just enough for 2 adults and 1 kid-sized human, I guess? So I don't recall when - perhaps it was a year ago, when I heard the bed shaking continuously from my father's actions. He was also breathing heavily and there was this sticky sound too. Gross enough, I know. At that point of time, I was already mature enough to assume that he was masturbating. It was enough to scar me though, because it was just so strange to think of your dad fapping in the middle of the night, in the same room as his daughter. I pretended that I was asleep, but that was a really shitty experience tbvh. I tried to convince myself that he was doing something else, like rubbing his nose, and brushed it off. I just refused to accept that he might be doing something so dirty and it took me so many years of my life to actually realise it? What?! Alright so today, I found out that not only does my dad engage in that sort of behaviour, so does my mum. I'm shocked lol. I don't know how I should go about knowing this. I searched for some advice on Google too, and I now learnt that it's supposed to be 'normal'? Is it so common? I'm so shooked because I thought my family were a conservative bunch. I'm their youngest child, and I thought they would have stopped all perverted acts since I was born. So how did I find out? I suddenly woke up to hear my dad shaking the entire bed again. This time, I was really unaware and asked my dad to shut up. Suddenly, my mum nagged at me slightly and I was so confused. My mum went to the washroom and started showering? Which was so odd and made no sense. And from the corner of my eye, I saw my dad wearing his underwear and pants! He slipped them on so easily I thought it might have been a daily practice for them. He zipped up his pants naturally and it came as an instant realisation to me that both of them were engaging in some indecent shit. What. The. Actual. Fuck. I slept in the same room with them for 17 years, and today I found out that both of them have been doing messed up shit and I was completely oblivious, up until today. It's so scarring, and I remember myself pretending I'm asleep. I knew before that my mum didn't wear a bra to sleep, but I really didn't know it might be more than just because it was more comfortable to sleep without one. Lmao. I'm really shocked at how they are doing things like this while I'm asleep. In the same room. And my dad makes such obvious sounds, I think it's sick. The thought of it disgusts me. I heard somewhere before that all men fap, regardless their age. Is it true? I'm starting to feel crept out, that men are so hormonal LOL. I suddenly feel so pure and this entire thought of my parents being naughty is scarring asf. Thoughts, anybody?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of shock, confusion, and discomfort regarding the poster's parents engaging in sexual activities while the poster is in close proximity and sleeping in the same room. The poster describes feeling scarred by these experiences and expresses disgust and disbelief at the behavior. The mention of pretending to be asleep and feeling unaware of these activities for a prolonged period of time suggests a significant impact on the poster's emotional well-being. However, it is important to note that this post does not necessarily indicate depression but rather a reaction to a distressing and uncomfortable situation."

I run and fight for the little bit of light I see through my window in the morning. but every night you are back. sometimes you don't even leave and it can be days, weeks, months til I get another chance at seeing the light.

"Post: Drifting away from my best friend My best friend and I have known each other for well over a decade, and have gone to the same schools and last year when she went away. We text everyday and see each other regularly but recently I’ve been feeling so disjointed from her. We’re really close and I’ve told her things I’ve never told anyone. She just got into her first serious relationship, had sex for the first time, got drunk for the first time and also had her first pregnancy scare (i was with her when she took the test). We’re 17 by the way. However, whenever we talk it’s always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. They’ve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. He’s emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things. I want to support her but she makes it so hard. She never asks about my life anymore. I’m going through a really tough time yet it’s never come up. All we talk about is her and her relationship. I know it’s a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her. I’ve never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like we’re just drifting apart. I don’t relate to her anymore. Obviously I love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her. I don’t know whether to keep putting effort into this friendship or not?

Reasoning: The post does convey a sense of sadness and dissatisfaction with the current state of the friendship. The poster expresses feeling disjointed, neglected, and irrelevant in their best friend's life. They also mention going through a tough time and feeling like the friendship has become one-sided. However, these emotions do not reach the level of profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The focus of the post is primarily on the dynamics of the friendship and the poster's uncertainty about whether to continue putting effort into it. It does not display the intense emotional distress or lack of enjoyment in life that is often present in individuals suffering from very severe depression."

"Post: should i be upset with my best friend? My best friend of over 10 years recently took her first trip to New York City. I was so excited for her, and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when I was there were. I knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift. When I gave her the gift, she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she didn't go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up. I know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering, which is why I feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful. I also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she didn't go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened. I want to know what other people's thoughts on this are before I talk to her, and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

While the poster expresses feelings of disappointment and hurt regarding their best friend's actions, there is no mention of overwhelming emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair.

"Post: Lately, I've been going to sleep later and later into the day just so I can avoid ppl and avoid dealing with depression/being sad. But, by the time I do wake up/can't sleep anymore, I feel more depressed than when I originally was. And yet, despite all of that, I still have this need to sleep excessively because I keep having dreams that are more entertaining, adventurous, and exciting than what's currently going on in my life. And even when I rewire my sleep schedule back to normal, I still end up going back to the messed up sleep schedule just cause I hate feeling depressed and hate dealing with it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of avoidance and isolation as a coping mechanism for dealing with depression. The poster describes going to sleep late in order to avoid people and the feelings of depression. This suggests a desire to escape from their emotions, which is indicative of emotional pain and distress. The mention of feeling more depressed upon waking up and a need to sleep excessively suggests a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in their waking life. The mention of having dreams that are more exciting and fulfilling than their reality further highlights the dissatisfaction and desire to escape from their current circumstances.

"Post: I [18F] finally feel like i’m getting better I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldn’t seem to find an escape. My parents tried their best but were at a loss. Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didn’t matter to him. He is the absolute best and I haven’t even thought about suicide for the past three months. It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure. Maybe your cure won’t be someone else, maybe it’ll be medicine or yourself but please don’t give up because i would have regretted it so much. The world has so much more to offer"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe. How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate. Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them. Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!""* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer). Anyways, Idk why I haven't visited this sub earlier, as I type these last words I already feel better because it is the first time I'm doing something like this. Feels like I've talked to someone. Thank you!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reveals several indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a desire to go to therapy but explains that their family's overprotectiveness and tendency to turn any mention of therapy into a big ordeal prevents them from seeking help. This indicates a significant barrier to accessing the support they need. The poster also describes a strong dislike of attention and a fear of negative reactions from their family if they were to seek therapy secretly. These feelings of shame, fear, and isolation align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The post also mentions feeling like something is wrong with them and wishing to be invisible for a week to sort out their inner problems, further emphasizing their emotional distress. Despite finding some solace in reading others' experiences and realizing that their own problems may not be as severe as others', the overall tone of the post conveys a deep sense of unhappiness, vulnerability, and the need for support."
"Post: When should you receive photos of your childhood? Hey all, My mother has all my childhood photos and memories locked up in her closet, along with those of my late father and his family, most of whom are long gone. I'm 37, married, father of 2... I'm just realizing the absurdity of this. The other day she offered to exchange one box of photos for another ""favor"" she wanted, which seemed rather hollow to me. These are my photos, right? The way she's currently handling it is that I'll only get these photos once she's dead... That could be up to 20 years or more, she's 76 currently. What makes this even more poignantly absurd is that I nearly died 2 years ago, the emergency surgery only had about 50% odds of survival. What is she gaining by this? Is this normal? Thanks"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of frustration and sadness regarding the situation with the poster's mother and the childhood photos. The poster describes feeling emotionally impacted by the fact that their mother is withholding the photos and memories, and expresses confusion and disbelief at this behavior. The mention of the mother offering to exchange the photos for a favor adds to the emotional distress and frustration. The poster's question about the normalcy of this situation suggests a level of emotional pain and confusion that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Susceptible Younger Sibling I have a sexually active younger sibling who severely lacks proper sex education. She will not confide in me, our parents or any family for that matter (she’s afraid that my extended family and myself will snitch to our highly-religious parents, who are against premarital sex), but casually revealed her ""activities” to our hairdresser who felt uneasy by what she had heard. With that said, the hairdresser informed me of what was said, fearing that my sister may be in danger of herself. Situation: My sister's partaking in sexual relations with her boyfriends (yes, boyfriends since they change every few weeks) WITHOUT protection. She has very low self-esteem, and goes for guys with “nothing going for them” (i.e. no job, no education, drug-dealing/taking, etc.). But what triggered my hairdresser (whose primary concern is SAFE sex) to contact me was the fact that her current boyfriend is uncircumcised, does not use protection and has convinced my sister that “pulling out” is safe sex—revealing their lack of adequate sex education. Furthermore, my sister has complained (to me/our parents) of yeast infections and UTI’s, checking in-and-out of the clinic on several occasions, but casually dismisses it as wearing too-tight skinny jeans. And while my mother is comfortably in-denial and takes everything my sister says for face value, my father and I have had our suspicions about what may really be going on for awhile now. Some background information: - Sister comes from an upper income family - Youngest of 3, very spoiled - Fast-tailed, boy-obsessed, hates being single - (Barely) of legal age (technically “grown”, but not independent, so she lives with our parents who expects her to live by their rules until she moves out). - Was brought up Christian - Strong preference for men from poverty-stricken/rougher backgrounds and engage in illegal activities (I suspect she thinks it’s edgy?) - Has a job, but devotes every last penny either uber-ing/lyft-ing to be with her (job-less) boyfriends or loaning them money - Loving immediate/extended family - Very manipulative, yet extremely impressionable when it comes to guys - Current boyfriend is from overseas, deals/does cocaine (and pressures her to join in), jobless, without education, ill-tempered, manipulative and violent. Also his parents are entirely against their relationship due to her being of a different race/ethnicity than him. - Previous boyfriend was also ill-tempered, manipulative and violent, but also physically/verbally abusive, dealt weed, had no job/HS drop-out and made a “runaway” attempt with my sister which was prevented after I “snitched” to my parents (hence the reason she no longer confides in me, but I felt it was necessary given the severity of the situation). Cops were even involved. My parents have attempted to send her to a prestigious out-of-state college to get her mind off of guys and focus on her studies, however she shows very little interest in education, let alone bettering herself in any form or fashion. She “lives in the now” and has a very blinkered outlook on life. With everything said, I would like advice on how to handle the situation (i.e. what to do with the information). Should I relay it to our parents and risk “rattling” on my hairdresser (i.e. the source/proof in which my parents will ask for)? Should I mind my business and risk my sister catching something more severe/getting pregnant/etc.? Not to mention her current boyfriend's gang/violent/drug-related background could potentially put our family at risk (she's revealed our location/faces via social media and casual talk--entirely against our wishes) should they ever break up or anything of the sort (we had to place a restraining order on her last violent boyfriend). I have a very strong conscience and do not believe that I could live with myself should the latter happen. Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to expound as much as possible to give an accurate reporting of the situation at hand. I have always been over-protective over family (my little sister especially), and it breaks my heart to see her follow such a destructive path. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thank you."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses concern and distress about their sibling's situation, as well as their own sense of responsibility and guilt, the primary focus of the post is seeking advice on how to handle the situation and protect their sister.

Post: I am beginning to think I am the third wheel So I am currently feeling a bit left out as my two best friends seem to be getting along together much more than they used to and they are beginning to push me away.

"Post: Ending a friendship (This post is insanely long FYI) I have a mate [17M, nearly 18] whose currently in a relationship with a girl [just turned 16] that he is completely infatuated by. He buys her stuff constantly, despite his financial situation (more on that later) and does lots of other things (also more on that later). This friend of mine completely revolves his life around this one girl. He once told me he would do anything for her and that he would kill himself if they broke up (he's also depressed, which I think he should fix before even being in a relationship but it's too late now) he also said he would feel 100% responsible if she were to kill herself (she's not depressed. It was hypothetical. When I told him it wouldn't be his fault as everyone is responsible for their own actions, I simply received a ""shut up"". There have been many incident like this where I've truth bombed him and he's stuck his head in the sand and might as well be saying ""lalala I can't hear you!"" Unfortunately for my mate, these feelings don't appear to be reciprocated. He buys her gifts all the time, even though his mum can barely afford fuel due to her unemployment and the fact she's a single mum. He bought her a bath bomb and perfume and other stuff for her birthday (would be upwards of $50 (Australian dollars btw if that's even a concern) from a family that sometimes has $0 in their bank account when he didn't even get anyone else (including me) a gift for our birthdays. The girl doesn't even seem phased by his financial situation or his depression. If she cared, wouldn't she ask to not have gifts to help him out?. Not to mention that she hasn't bought A THING for my mate. In real life they seem like a stable couple but it's much worse. The mate also purposely neglects invites from his mates (including me) for her. We invited him to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he messaged her about how he didn't really want to go (me and a mate broke into his Snapchat account. His iPad charger is broken and he can't afford another one so he gave us username and password to Snapchat so we could do his streaks which apparently matter. Also this is another testiment to his financial situation. Can't afford a cheapo third party cord for his iPad) We looked through his messages and pretty much he's sending ""almost nudes"" thankfully with consent and a thotty dog filter picture (even though he would call anyone else that did it a thot to fit in) he also constantly asked to call on discord to which she replied only with ""sorry"" or ""can't"". No explanation whatsoever. Her friends are also incredibly irresponsible (thankfully he sees through that) When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment ""what if she doesn't like me"" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it. When he was at a very dark time in his life, me and 3 of my mates (2 girls including the girlfriend and one guy) made a group chat to talk about how we help him. We all talked very in depth except for the girlfriend. My mate asked her ""what do you think of all this were talking about (we went very in depth into his situation) to which her response was ""I don't know"" after saying NOTHING. I'm sick of his ignorance. I'm sick of him neglecting me and the other lads. I'm sick of it all. He even tried to seize control from his girlfriend. She went to hi five me and he said ""why are you bringing him over here"" in an incredibly annoyed tone"" I know I'm only the ""when Chloe isn't present talk to him isntead"" guy. He doesn't care. How do I cut him out of my life whilst causing the least ruccus possible? (I have 2 other friends who have identical opinions so if you offered advice I'd be able to tell them too) If you have anything I need to clarify please ask and I will do so. I typed all this on a phone so it's kinda hard. Thankyou very much to those who read and answer."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

My situation with her is exactly like in the movie ""Before we go"" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed. The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry. Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed. I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love. This is the beginning of the end. Please help."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a multitude of emotional indicators that align with very severe depression. The poster describes a long-standing battle with depression, including a significant event triggering a relapse. The mention of the happiest days of their life being the last three days spent with a ""perfect stranger"" indicates a lack of fulfillment or happiness in their regular life.

The post also reveals feelings of guilt and a fear of burdening others, which can be associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of hopelessness, despair, and the belief that this is the beginning of the end showcases significant emotional distress commonly associated with depression."

"Post: Is it normal for a dad to say this to his daughter? Sorry if this isn’t the right sub. Just need an outsiders opinion on this issue. My dad will often make *jokes* about my weight, for example: Tonight we were having dessert and I didn’t want any, he told me to stuff it in my fat little face. A few days ago, I was eating chips and he said I’m gonna get chubby, before that, he says stuff like “Nobody likes the fat chick” He says I’m gonna “get fat like my mom when I’m older” that’s another thing, my parents are divorced due to my mom cheating and if I’m being sarcastic towards him or anything he says “I’m gonna give you to your mom if you’re not careful.” It’s like I’m an object instead of a person? I do a hell of a lot of housework and all, it hurts to hear him *joke* about that. I just feel like this isn’t something you should say to your 15 y/o daughter. He’s a great dad besides the comments he makes here and there. I got pretty upset by the comment he made tonight cause I’ve been dealing with weight issues and self esteem. He didn’t understand why I got upset cause it’s a joke to him. I dunno, am I being overly sensitive?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: {Experience} Angry Sibling I have a sister who will tell you she's the most laid-back of us all, but the truth is her anger will zoom from zero to 10 in the blink of an eye. When we converse she will criticize or take exception with something I've said and I have to gently remind her that I'm only telling her how I *feel*; I'm not disagreeing with her opinion, or whatever. Thing is, it's getting more and more difficult to talk with her as it seems as though *ANYTHING* sets her off these days! And while I've nothing at all against Bill Burr - I actually think he's hilarous! - talking to her is like trying to talk back to one of his on-stage rants, understand?! Because he's ranting to be funny, but she actually means what she says. I love this sister, and am closer to her than many of the five sisters I have, but I'm beginning to point this out to her because I don't think she realizes the way she sounds.

"Post: Am i a bad friend? I don't know what to do Recently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let's call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they've cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of ""you KNOW what you did"" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don't. I've never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I'm friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there's a long list of reasons why I'm a terrible friend but he ""doesn't have time to list them"" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I've confided in other friends who assure me that I'm not a bad friend, although I've asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch. Back to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I'm ""acting like a bitch"". I've tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I've tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don't know what I've done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn't responded at all. (Quite frankly i don't expect her to). Bottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I'll be seeing a lot of K this year as we're studying the same course, and J is one of my brother's best friends. Please help"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of confusion, insecurity, and self-doubt, questioning their own worth as a friend.

I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her. They were gone. I didn't get to see their face and if I did I think it would've destroyed me. I crossed the bridge, pulled over and called the police. I wish I could've helped, yelled something, gotten out of my car. I don't know. I didn't even know her but I feel as though I've lost someone close.

Almost every night for the past few months now ends up with me either crying in a pillow and thinking about how shitty my life has been, or researching and thinking about fast ways to die.

"Post: Does anyone else feel like this? Do you know that feeling where you just feel... lost? You feel trapped in a world that you didn't want to be in, forced to try and functional like a normal member of society. You want to die, but you're so conflicted about death. You're conflicted about everything. You can't decide whether it'd be better to feel nothing or to let out all your emotions. You procrastinate so much, because it all feels so worthless.

"Post: Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much. My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me. I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely. I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe. I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I've struggled with this for 12 years now. I don't know how much more I can take."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a pervasive sense of hopelessness, worthlessness, and exhaustion. The poster describes a monotonous and unfulfilling daily routine, expressing a lack of joy or meaning in their life. The breakup with their ex-girlfriend is particularly impactful, as it caused a resurgence of their depression and feelings of invisibility and rejection. The poster expresses a belief that they are inherently flawed and that no amount of effort or improvement will change their situation. They express a lack of interest in life and contemplate the idea of death as a means of escape. The mention of their cat being their only source of comfort and the concern for their well-being indicates a deep emotional connection and a sense of responsibility towards their pet.

"Post: Do you feel the same? After seeing many of my classmates being successful in their lifes, I felt terrible… the trouble inside me just rooted even deeper. I don’t feel productive as I should be. I feel like I just want to sleep forever, not having to care about anything. I texted so many people that says to text them when I need them, but none of them replied. Maybe it is because of me who scared them away? Maybe it is because I’m an introvert who hates interacting with people? I just want someone who really cares about me, who will cheer me up when I’m sad. Right now, I’m just wondering why they have lifes that are so easy when compared to me? I have problem both physically and emotionally.

They express jealousy towards others who seem to have easy lives and desperately ask for something that will give them hope to live on. The overall tone and content of the post strongly align with the symptoms commonly associated with depression, indicating a significant level of emotional distress."
"Post: When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university's health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day. I went from about 20mg to 5mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today (several weeks without) and I feel like i'm having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i'm a 22 year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past 2 weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair. This is all very interesting considering I got on this and xanax because i couldnt even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown. Another instance is when I stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge Dont fucking quit cold turkey. I thought I could handle it but I definitely cant. I just hope this ends soon. I honestly feel like i'm losing it entirely"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress, despair, and a clear deterioration in the poster's mental state. The poster describes experiencing a mental breakdown, crying multiple times, and becoming increasingly angry and violent. These intense emotional reactions, coupled with self-destructive behavior (throwing a chair and damaging property), indicate a significant level of emotional and psychological turmoil. The poster also mentions the inability to handle basic tasks without experiencing a nervous breakdown, demonstrating a significant impairment in functioning. The overall tone of hopelessness, desperation, and a sense of losing control aligns with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression. The abrupt cessation of Lexapro, a commonly used antidepressant, without proper medical supervision is also a concerning factor that can contribute to worsening depressive symptoms."
"Post: It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress and struggle. The poster describes feeling like they are heading towards a dark place and mentions previous difficulties in education that have affected their self-esteem and outlook on their future.

The poster also mentions a lack of enjoyment in activities they used to love and feeling unable to handle the day at times. These factors, combined with the tone of the post and the overall expression of emotional distress, suggest that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression."

"Post: When people with good intentions say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it? Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me. Now the issue I'm facing. I don't feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt don't go away from what he said either. It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame. The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back. This makes me sad. I didn't really want him involved, but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help isn't wanted."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Why am I like this? Sometimes I feel really depressed, i think I'm at the lowest of my life and I can't do anything productive, I'm so tired. And, like, an hour after, I feel like my depression isn't real and that I can do anything and I feel good and see all the things I can do to feel better.

"Post: Friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke. OK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn't a big deal. Therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting. However I told my friend that my therapist fancied me etc whilst things were happening. I told her to promise to keep it a secret even if I died. Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job. Anyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as ""daddy nick"" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn't really message the tutor any of this. She freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: ""I'm going to ruin your therapists life for this!"" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren't. She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life. I feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off. She then asked me how my rabbit is doing??? Like I want to speak to her now???

"Post: Help - unplanned pregnancy at 41, wife wants to keep it Hello, I need some real advice. My wife and I were married in 2011. We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3). Brief introduction of us - I'm almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom. We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won't lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn't been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives. After the birth of our second child, I was done. I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn't really wanting to do it either for other reasons. My wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling. She is an excellent, patient mother to our children. However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her ""baby fix"" with friends newborns. I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant. Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at. I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie. When she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn't have the energy, our family was complete already. Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we'd have to buy a larger house and I don't need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn't the reaction she was hoping to hear. The next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn't healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn't be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I'm suffering physical ailments as well and don't have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won't be there to be the ""relief valve"" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the ""next phase"" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly. One day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup. I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue. I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen. I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness. The next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn't interested, and she can't force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our ""next phase"" of children would just have to wait a few more years. I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child's high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the ""old dad"". I said I wouldn't care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound't go with her to the doctor appointment. I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be. It's only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself.

"Post: Is My Friend A Bad Friend? I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, we’ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I don’t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didn’t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly can’t hold it in and I wanna know if I’m just being sensitive.. These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends.. 1.We use eachother’s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. Sure she couldve been being nice and I could’ve been acting emotional but I really didn’t like other people who I didn’t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said “Funny. U wouldn’t wanna see the other screenshot I took.” And we both didn’t say anything. And she didn’t change it. 2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isn’t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesn’t laugh at anything funny I have to say. I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didn’t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended. 3.She doesn’t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else. 4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didn’t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I don’t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didn’t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this. 5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesn’t care for it. 6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. After a year passed, I texted her. I can’t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now we’re talking like friends again. But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldn’t be guilty about. 7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. I’m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesn’t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I can’t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesn’t realize how much she hurted me What should I do..? Am I just being sensitive..?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Reddit isn't a nice place for someone who suffers depression. I think it's funny how sometimes we take internet so seriously. I have no idea why the rudness of some totally strange person, probably between 12-16, made me so... down. I think it's because I use Reddit a lot as someway of just...

"Post: Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that wasn’t turned to a sad story? I’m starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, can’t recall a time in my life where I was happy. I don’t even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I don’t allow others to either, because it doesn’t mean much to get praised for things I should’ve accomplished a long time ago. Anyways, I’m on meds and truth is, I don’t feel like myself? I don’t think any drug can make me feel myself? Depression in some wicked way has made me become the person I am today.

"Post: Cousin cutting off family. So my cousin has stopped talking to any of our family including his mother and brother. I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis). My cousin never replied and money aside I can tell this really hurt my dad (he's bottling it, but I can tell) considering this is my Dad's favorite nephew. I feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult (he just barely turned 19) and I texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is (our grandma died of the same condition) and how he shouldn't cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him, but it's been 3days already. My main motivation for this is that I know stage 4 cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and I want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be God forbid his last few years. I just wanted to talk about this. Advice is very welcome and before anyone suggests he doesn't have the money, he does, he just sold the car we sold him for above market value and has a very good paying job as a mechanic at a car dealership."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I feel like a useless member of my family I may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house. But, I’d like to think I do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing. My wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house. Car keys, laundry, tools, you name it, they will get lost around the house. I have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever I go. This way I don’t have to be asking her all the time where to find X item. This was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day. Since then, I only bring the key of the car that I bring with me. Well,.... didn’t take too long til that one got lost too.... I needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere. I asked her where it was and she responded with “you have hands and eyes, you find it”. I blew my top off. I yelled at her that the fact that I have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous! She brought up the fact that I could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy. I told her I would if she wasn’t so damn unorganized. Every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway! She is type A personality and I would like to think I am type A-. I yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much. Maybe the reason I don’t do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway, an unorganized mess.... I at least do the basics. I pickup after dinner. I take out the trash, (this job now goes to my son). Handyman work, I fix plumbing, appliances, broken doors, tv’s, computers, iPhones. I would like to think that I play my role as a dad as perfect as I can. I help with homework, I play with my kids all the time. I feed them when mom works early or wants to sleep in/go to bed early. She’s mad at me and I feel like I am trying my best but my best is not good enough. Also, says I have become obese because of my laziness...... that one really hurt..... I try to walk/jog a good 30-40 minutes 2-3 times a week if I have time. I broke down in my car today after seeing some old photos of my kids when they were babies..... Sorry for formatting, I am on mobile and writing is not my thing. I am more of a numbers guy........."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Forcing myself to the gym to better myself while also wanting myself to end Getting up and getting there is by far the hardest part, and having never experienced the part where 'it gets easier' I'm running out of excuses to bother going beyond the fact I've told people I'm going."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Getting to Know a Stranger A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor Getting to Know a Stranger! A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor Getting to Know a Stranger is a human project looking to get to know someones life by giving an hour (I always encourage it to go longer) to Getting to Know Stranger that other wise I would have never met. There is no monetary exchange only one of friendship and kindness. I would like to document our meeting with a few candid photos only if you are comfortable, if not, a conversation does the trick! Getting to Know a Stranger is all inclusive and strives to get to know all walks of life. I welcome all ages, gender identities, races, religious views, economic status.…. you know every type of Human! I know that in my own life I have felt extremely alone and isolated in my own mind many times, and have felt that there is NO one who understands what I am going through. What I started to notice was through my own travels and tribulations I have noticed one thing, we are all a lot a alike, and most of the time share a more relatable story then anyone in my inner circle. In todays technology the human interaction is becoming less and less human and more and more digitized. Screen watching instead of people watching, direct messaging instead of a hand written letter are methods of detachment driving a wedge between our true selves and the human being sitting across from us. So how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction. A little about me! My name is Aaron Bistrin I am a 28 year old guy from Santa Cruz California, a beautiful place to grow up. However it wasn't always easy growing, Santa Cruz can be a tricky place to navigate as youth and I found myself in quite a bit of trouble very young. This continued into my early 20’s and after a series of life changing events I started to make some serious changes in my life. As one positive lead to another, I found myself opening a restaurant in my home town at the age of 25. Fast forward a few years and I have found myself out of the restaurant industry and creating an alternative marketing company with my best friend. This is where I found my love for photography and content creation. My passion for human interaction and learning about people has been inherit nature since I was a child. I feel when meeting strangers our filters are down, there are no pre programmed family/community paradigms, is this not the best opportunity to be your true self? So what better than combine my two passions of photography and human interaction into a Human Thesis with a Photography Minor. Getting to Know a Stranger. If you or someone you know could use a kind interaction by Getting to Know a Stranger, please comment below or shoot me an email at abistrin@yahoo.com. All meeting are private unless the consent from both people is given. This is a project of human kindness. Hope to meet you soon! Much love!

"Post: I've never liked myself. Honestly, I think that my entire life I've been depressed, but now that I'm older (19 y/o), I've realized what it actually is. All my life I remember hating myself and wishing I could be somebody else. I thought it was normal. I always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action I took. The only time I *ever* felt happy about myself was after a psilocybin mushroom trip. But that's besides the point. I've always hated myself but I was too naive to know what it was and I thought it was normal. Why can't I be normal? Edit: You know what, fuck this I'm gonna edit this. I don't think I'll get better. I don't think there is a better way of living. Anytime I am ""happy"" or ""over it"", it all comes crashing the fuck down and becomes 10x worse. I don't trust that fucking shit called ""happiness"". It's always a lie and always lets me down. I'd rather be depressed and suicidal because at least I know it's real. It's not some bullshit fleeting feeling that I get that leads to disappointment. Reddit comments and therapists and shit can tell me I'm mistaken, but that's all bullshit because it's all a fucking lie and the only real emotion is emptiness, fear, self loathing, and paranoia.

Reasoning: The post clearly expresses a deep sense of self-hatred, low self-esteem, and a longstanding history of feeling depressed. The poster describes always wishing to be someone else and envying others, indicating a consistent lack of self-acceptance and dissatisfaction with their own identity. The mention of experiencing brief happiness only with the use of psilocybin mushrooms suggests a limited ability to find joy or fulfillment in their everyday life. The edit in the post expresses a sense of hopelessness, disbelief in the possibility of getting better, and a preference for feeling depressed and suicidal because it feels more real than fleeting moments of happiness. These strong emotional indicators of self-loathing, despair, and suicidal ideation align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."

"Post: I'm 20 years old today The one thing I wanted for my birthday would've been a relationship. I feel so lonely all the damn time, and the one girl who I admitted my feelings to AND apparently likes me back is already dating someone else. My grades are dropping, I'm losing sleep, and I distract myself by playing video games in my dorm room all day like the useless loser I am.

I don’t think there is anything wrong with me not wanting kids. And I don’t think there is anything wrong with people that do want kids.

Suicide is all I can think of right now and I'm scared to do it only because the thought of becoming a vegetable and having to live like that terrifies me. I guess this is one more step I'm trying out to kind of ease myself into the whole thing. People told me 10 years ago to stick with it because it'll get better. They still tell me that even though I would love to go back 10 years now because of how much worse its gotten and how much better even that was compared to now. I didn't think it would get this bad but it did. I've been through so many medications, doctors, checked myself into a hospital 3 times when I was sure I was going to do kill myself, called the suicide hotline several times, talked with friends, made lifestyle changes and all that. It still didn't work. I've only gotten more depressed. There's no helping me. I am just supposed to feel miserable. I'll never be happy. I'm not sure at this point if I even want to be happy anyways. Hoping I can work up the courage to kill myself by the end of today. I'm really scared to do it but its something I really need to do for my own sake."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Post: A little less sad tonight I really don't know what to say anymore. I can't say anything about stuff I love to people without feeling like I am a burden to them. Tonight I landed my first kickflip from the street on to the curb. I've been skating for about 10 years now and never been able to do that until now. It may not seem like a lot but it's a challenge that I've faced with fear most of my life. I'm so happy right now I have no one to share it with so I thought this would be the best place to share it with. I normally don't feel happy anymore or generally feel content but right now I do and I want everyone to share something that they're proud of or something that made them hopeful or brought them comfort in a time of misery.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a mixture of negative emotions, such as feeling like a burden to others and not being able to share their joys with anyone. The mention of not feeling happy or content in general indicates a persistent low mood. However, the post also mentions a rare moment of happiness and wanting to share it with others. This contrasting emotion of happiness, while positive, is accompanied by a sense of loneliness and isolation, suggesting a possible depressive state. The overall tone of the post leans towards sadness and a lack of fulfillment, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Has your family always ignored your problem? I think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering. I don't ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I'm ungrateful and spoilt. I've had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back. What else could I possibly need? I don't want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just I feel so abandoned."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses deep emotional pain and feelings of abandonment. The poster describes their family's indifference towards their depression and the lack of support they received since childhood.

The poster also expresses fear of burdening or blaming anyone and a sense of feeling abandoned despite having their basic needs met. These experiences and emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, indicating a significant level of emotional distress."
"Post: Ideas for sleep? Hey guys, I’m not sure if I’m depressed, I’ve never been officially diagnosed. However, I feel a sense of deep sadness and fear almost constantly, but I hide it super well. The fear aspect seems to get worse at night, im not afraid of one specific thing it just turns into an overall consuming dread. I want to cry like 80% of nights but I simply can’t. I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing. However, I can’t sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night. I only want to use sleeping pills as a very very last resort.

I don't feel like I am doing anything worth-while, but I also don't even feel qualified to do even this job. When I get home, all I want to do is either sleep or sit in front of my computer. When I am on my computer, I never do anything productive, just get into YouTube holes that last forever. I try to be creative; maybe try game design, or start writing; but it all just falls flat and I feel worse, not good enough. I have no real friends (not including work acquaintances, who all have their own lives to live) in my area, all of them are online, and again, they all have their own lives too.

"Post: Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then. After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I've accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really don't know."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Today is my 21st birthday. I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine. Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine, ""13th birthday: I had just been let out of a mental hospital a few days before. My mother finds out she has a brain tumor. My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early. 14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves. 16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me. 17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom."" To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown.

As of the last 2 months they have been unactive (We only talk online and see each other from time to time), not talking to me, saying they get bored of our conversation, never starting a conversation. And never consider to invite me to hangout, they just do it for themselves. I'm not sure how to feel anymore, when I am in person with them we have tons of fun, and sometimes when we talk the conversations are really interesting and fun too.

"Post: :) So yesterday was my 18th birthday, and here my dumbass was expecting it to be different than all my other ones, but boy was I wrong. It's nice to know that no one gives a fuck about you. You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you've just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you're laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it.

"Post: Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I've ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they're a group of guys that I don't have a lot in common with and we don't really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They're nice and I'm happy to be friends with them, but it's hard for me to really get to know them because they do ""guy stuff"" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I'm totally not interested in/they don't bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I'm growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they're not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it's not their fault -- they're just causal online friends that shouldn't have to cater to my current host of mental problems. I'm totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they're still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I've never been able to have a ""normal"" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don't enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn't work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don't have a single person that I could ask to go with me. When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I've ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we've all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There's not really anything I can ""join"" like that in a non-college town... I've been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven't started but I'm doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people. I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can't even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I've ever known or heard of. I've never been serious about suicide, but recently that's changed and it's becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I'm a long way from that but at this point I don't see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone. Does anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem? I'm so lost and sad and pathetic"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly demonstrates a profound sense of emotional pain and hopelessness. The poster expresses feelings of loneliness, depression, and being overwhelmed.

Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress, with the poster expressing intense upset and distress, but an inability to cry or release their emotions.

"Post: Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance So what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation. My fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity. Now for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism. Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable around him at times. My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore. My fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active. It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll include children right away, but just my fiance and I. When we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance. I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball. I know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits a strong emotional distress, but it does not align with very severe depression. The poster expresses frustration, exhaustion, and a desire for independence and personal growth. They discuss the challenges of living with their sister's fiancé and the impact it has on their own relationship and plans. While there is a mention of feeling uncomfortable around the fiancé due to a past incident, it does not dominate the overall emotional tone of the post. The post focuses more on the desire for autonomy, the need for boundaries within the family, and the future plans with their fiancé. Although the poster expresses fatigue and a desire for peace, it does not display the hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I give up trying, eat healthy, exercises blah fucking blah what’s the point when I still fucking wake up wanting to die and cry myself to sleep every night? Just lost all hope, I think some people are made for this life and others are just not and I’m one of those people. When will the day come I don’t imagine suicide or my own funeral? It’s been non stop hell for 5 years and I don’t see it ever getting better. I hope for the rest of you it does I really do but for me I’ve just given up I’ve ran out of hope."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, despair, and a desire for death.

"Post: Calling me a bitch as a form of endearment not cool This was a great friend of seven years. We had so much in common and a few things not in common. We met in our mid and early 20s (im being 5 years younger). We met on a the job years ago. Well five months ago when she was stressing about her day... Listen bitch our manager gave us more rules.... Time froze like huh? :/😨 Also I'm 30 shes 35. I let it slide since I thought maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she was so stressed out? Well it didn't end and got worse... Everyday she leave me text messages, and recordings updating me of her life and each sentence I was called a bitch. Listen BITCH.... Yeeees BITCH..... Then this BITCH at work....,but you get me BITCH.... I told myself, BITCH you need to hit the gym ( Yes at times she called herself a bitch which is fine.) Lucky for men they'll never get called bitch by her. I made excuses for her saying maybe it's a temp phase. 3 months in I told her I don't like being a bitch every sentence positive or not. She said this how her and her family always talked. I thought I known you for 7 years...never heard of this. Then she continued to talk and yup calling me a bitch. I continued telling her to stop at times. Other times I just tried to ignore. One month ago she texted me that shes working with a nurse who is a woman who has a grill in her mouth. And how cool she thought that was. And how she hopes to become a nurse someday with a grill. I had to catch myself....to me grills look ugly on men and worse on women😝. I faked it like....yea...um cool... :/ Well a 5 days ago I got fed up. I told her 6 days ago calling me a BITCH 50 or so times a day must stop! We never had a argument...maybe a few disagreements. She went off and was pissed I didn't want to be called bitch for fun. I told her I'm not a dog in heat! I told her my name and that I'm a girl or woman hell even calling me a female is nicer. She said shes not about that girl power or that feminism crap! FYI...shes actually into feminism and don't know it. I would love to be a house wife,take my voting rights away and I love dresses. Shes willing to support a 3rd world man soon,talk about how if she gets a great degree she can support her man lol. I felt myself at the time great sadness here she was going off at me for not wanting to be called a bitch. She then says her family call each other bitches alllll the time. After she went off....she went back to talking about how she wants to go to school. I never felt so degraded and disrespected. I decided this friendship ends. I'm very nice, and consider how others feel....she basically treated me like a door mat. Next day I texted her I'm not a dog. Not into being called a bitch daily and I no longer can do this. After I texted that I blocked her number asap. It's crazy about 3 or 4 months ago. She was mad that when she called a coworker a bitch instead of saying girl or other friendly terms...she caught that coworker talking about her warning others to stay clear of her because she will call you a bitch. She called me about it all mad. I told her I actually understand that girl....she completely ignored my remark. I plan on changing my number soon...maybe. But I do feel better that I don't have to hear that hood talk anymore. I was her only friend. Hopefully she can make new friends who don't mind being called that daily. I have friends and recently by mistake made a new one. New one is like me and we respect each others boundaries. I like that shes another race as well,so I can learn her view of things. Yes just glad it's over. Now if I'm called a bitch it's a insult :)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster suffers from depression. While the post does describe a troubled friendship and feelings of degradation and disrespect, the focus is more on the specific issue of being called a derogatory term rather than expressing broader emotional distress. The post ends with a sense of relief and empowerment, indicating a resolution to the situation rather than ongoing symptoms of depression."
"Post: Is it me? Hello. This is my first time posting here. So the other day one of my friends texted me, saying I think she's dumb and that she demands respect (this is a month after I just hung out with her; everything seemed fine). She then accused me of insulting her and the school she goes to. I insisted that she took what I said out of context (for example she said I think her major is easy. I never said this, I said it wasn't math focused. Plus she herself said she is having an easy time). She constantly asks me if I think she is intelligent and I always tell her she's smart in her own way like everyone is. Anyway, I said sorry and have a good holiday but she didn't reciprocate and just told me to watch what I say and not to tell anyone she said this. This isn't the first time this kind of thing happened. One person I know just hates me (quote:""*** hates you and everything about you. He just does."") and I have no idea why. Sometimes he's cool, other times he ignores me (he has pointed out that I'm light skinned black and he's dark so apparently I'm treated better; eveb if that's true I am not responsible for that). Another person hated me for reasons unbeknownst to me (excluded me from group chats and gatherings, made this known to others) and now I'm told they love me (largely made up with this person but I never knew why they hated me to begin with). I'm extremely confused by all of this. Now I'm a guy who was known as the smart, quiet kid in school with a lot of knowledge. Occasionally I'll let people know my opinions and they'll get a kick out of it. However, I really made it a point to be polite to people even when I disagreed with them or didn't like them. Most people I know say I'm genuinely kind or polite even to the point of being boring.I go out of my way to refrain from cracking mean jokes or speaking bluntly because I know it'll offend people. I try to balance the thoughts in my head and the words I speak (isn't this normal?). Most people at my current school say I'm very nice and friendly. Am I doing something wrong or are people just being bad/weird to me? TL;DR: I tend to get people who hate me and I don't know why; most people say I'm a kind and logical person."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The main topic of the post is the confusion and frustration the poster feels about certain people disliking them for unknown reasons. While there may be some feelings of hurt or confusion, the overall tone is more focused on seeking understanding and reassurance rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. The poster also mentions that most people describe them as kind and logical, which indicates a level of self-awareness and confidence that is not typically associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I need help to understand it myself Dear people of r/depression, I need advice for motivation and mental calmness. I have had my share of depression in the past, but I have tried hard, so hard to make my life as happy as I could. But I think recently I have lost all my motivation for everything. There are days where I just want to play games and sleep all day because that probably is the only way to keep me bloody sane. Then there are days where I completely fine, but I don't think I have the same fire in me when I was younger. Recent mistakes (Failing in my university units, failing to find a job, failure in relationship) are making me nihilistic, self loathing and just feeling really pathetic. But of course, I can't just keep using my mistakes as an excuse to not get the fuck up and do something with my life... but I think I have ran out of ideas and motivation to push myself anymore."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster describes a loss of motivation, lack of fire or passion, and feeling nihilistic and self-loathing. They express a sense of hopelessness and feeling trapped in their current state, mentioning days where they just want to play games and sleep all day as a way to cope. The mention of recent failures in their academic, professional, and personal life further contribute to their feelings of self-loathing and a lack of direction.

"Post: How do I get confidence and motivation? Anyone else not accomplish anything in their life? I'm a loner, loser, and I don't fit in anywhere. I'm only 17 but I should have done something with my life by now. Never played sports, never got a job, never had real friends, never had confidence just anxiety (I believe this to be a major factor that prevents me from doing things). Stay home all day on PS4, no motivation, no happiness, no passions, and no dreams. Most would say they look forward to getting out of high school yet I'm the opposite. I don't look forward to the future. I don't want to go to college although I probably will anyways, and I don't want to work a job I'll hate. I'm a lazy shit and I hate myself for it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of confidence, motivation, and a sense of accomplishment. The poster describes feelings of being a loner, loser, and not fitting in anywhere. They express regret for not having achieved anything at the age of 17 and mention not participating in sports, lacking a job, real friends, confidence, happiness, passions, and dreams. The mention of anxiety as a major factor preventing them from taking action further suggests emotional distress.

"Post: What's wrong with this friendship? I need some thoughts on this situation. Three friends of 20 years decide a month a head of time to go to a Gatsby Party for New Years Eve. All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months. Melanie and Jenny can see that Charlotte is smitten. Ok, no big deal. All is good. ""Do you, girlfriend! Just don't lose yourself"". (Names have been changed) So everyone is planning for the NYE party. Melanie and Jenny have their outfits ready to go. The dress that Charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party, so the back-up plan is to go the mall and find a new dress. Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won't arrive on time. The ladies planned to all go to Melanie's house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party. The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they're not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway. Anyhow, on Jan 31, at 5pm-ish, Charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies: Hey ladies, i know you'll probably hate me for this, but I'm not gonna go. I wasn't feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now James asked me to go to Vegas. So I rather do that. I apologize for the late notice"". Needless to say, the other women were very upset. Any thoughts? Should the other ladies accept that?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not appear to indicate a significant level of emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. While there may be some mild disappointment or frustration expressed by the poster and the other women involved in the situation, it does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, numbness, or exhaustion commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking opinions and advice on how to handle the situation rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: I can't handle this anymore I have no perspective in life. I am 19 but I feel like a 50 year old alcoholic. When I drink, I can't stop. Just for your information: I am ""only"" a social drinker. But the thing is, I am done. I don't know how I could get old. I can't handle life now even though I get everything spoonfed by my parents. I don't know how I could handle it later. I'm at that point where I don't even care if a car hits me. The thought of death is just so relieving. Btw I'm incredibly drunk (again) right now and I just wanted to share this."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and lack of perspective in life. The poster describes feeling older than they actually are and having a destructive relationship with alcohol.

The overall tone of the post is filled with emotional distress, self-destructive behavior, and a sense of not being able to handle life. These indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
"Post: Friends don't seem to want to do anything unless I do all the work? I've been running into this problem a lot lately. If I don't pull all the weight around my friends, nothing happens. Admittedly these are, yes, all online friends. I don't really have ""Realside"" friends any more. It's complicated. What I mean is- if I don't start a conversation, there will be no conversation. If there's a lull in the conversation, I've got to fill it or the conversation ends there. If I make plans with my friends (Usually to play a game, watch a movie, something like that) there's a 90% chance they'll forget, or just lose interest, or ignore it. And a 10% chance they'll halfass it when it happens. What the hell am I doing wrong? I can't be sparklingly, Vegas-Light-Display interesting 24-7, it's fucking exhausting. But if I'm not, I'm alone."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does reflect some feelings of frustration and loneliness, but it does not exhibit the severe emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The poster describes a pattern of their online friends not showing initiative in maintaining conversations or following through with plans. However, there is no mention of deep sadness, despair, or lack of motivation, which are typical symptoms of depression. The overall tone of the post seems more focused on seeking advice and understanding why their friends behave in this way, rather than expressing intense emotional pain or hopelessness."
Post: My friends are throwing a LAN party ...and I wasn't invited. I was the only one who didn't get an invitation.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys feelings of exclusion and loneliness. The poster expresses sadness and hurt over not being invited to a LAN party that their friends are throwing.

"Post: Spending Valentine’s Day alone... when I shouldn’t be. Over the weekend, I told a girl who i thought liked me too about how I felt about her and I asked if she wanted to go to dinner on Valentine’s Day. I thought it’d be a nice thing... her and I are very similar, we don’t have great social skills, we both write for our schools newspaper and other crap. Her response was nice, but I feel like I totally fucked up with a beautiful girl. I’ve never really had anything with a girl and I’m 21 years old. So, I guess I’m alone tmrw when I could’ve asked the girl if she just wanted to hang out. Just being in her presence is so fun, but now I feel so much negative tension between us. Fuck."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of loneliness, disappointment, regret, and self-blame. The poster had the courage to express their feelings to someone they liked and asked them out for Valentine's Day, but their perception of having made a mistake and their fear of ruining their relationship with the person they like indicates a sense of low self-worth and pessimism. The mention of never having had anything with a girl at the age of 21 suggests a lack of self-confidence and possibly a history of unsuccessful romantic relationships, which can be indicators of depression. The overall tone of frustration, self-criticism, and negative emotions aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Is my friend a narcisist? I have this ""friend"" who I find kinda annoying. Because of my not so social nature I am used to being the third wheel, but this person, let's call him ""Eric"", seems to have me as an option. Now, we met each other due to a drama club where I managed to get myself into a script writing role, he wanted in. Me being an innocent 11 year old at the time, I didn't think much of it. Now, 17, here are a few factors that lead me to believe the title: 1) I dont care about what other people think of me. Whenever he can he always speaks to his other friends, let's call him ""Mark,"" Mark doesn't like conflict and therefore listens to everyone. I am his secondary option. 2) Whenever I do better than him at something he always tries to make himself seem better and that I just got lucky. He says things like: ""You just used 10 more minutes, so you did worse"" ""You always get lower or equal to the mark I get."" 3) he tries to get me to adapt to him by saying things like: ""Did you really choose that haircut? Its bad"" Or ""I am dissapointed in you"" And ""We're soul-friends"" (trying to make me agree with him) 4) He is always butting into conversations with my other friends, trying to pull me away from them 5) He tries to convince me that I'll do better at life with him rather than anyone else. Again, I don't take any of this to heart and generally just ignore him, but should I make it clear that I know what hes doing, or am I just being paranoid?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits some signs of potential emotional distress, such as feeling annoyed, being the third wheel, and questioning the nature of the friendship. However, these emotions alone do not necessarily indicate severe depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking advice and clarification about the friend's behavior, rather than expressing overwhelming feelings of hopelessness or despair. While it is possible that the poster may be experiencing some negative emotions, the post does not provide enough evidence to conclude that they suffer from depression."
"Post: They say be yourself, but what if yourself is someone nobody (including yourself) likes? I can just tell that people...tolerate me. Even my own ""friends."" It makes me want to just walk into the woods. Does anyone else feel this way?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of self-disgust and lack of self-worth. The poster feels disliked and believes that even their own friends only tolerate them. The mention of wanting to walk into the woods suggests a desire for escape or even self-harm. This level of self-rejection, combined with thoughts of escaping or self-harm, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of hopelessness, feeling unwanted, and the desire for isolation indicates significant emotional distress."
Post: chronic Illness and depression I have type 1 diabetes and I know it doesn’t seem much but having something constantly effecting your mood and knowing that it will only get worse and lead to further health problems down the track really gets to me...," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of emotional distress and a link between the individual's chronic illness (type 1 diabetes) and their depression. The poster acknowledges that their illness affects their mood and anticipates future health problems, which contributes to their emotional state. This indicates that the individual's mental health is impacted by their physical condition, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone suggests a level of emotional burden and concern about their future, further supporting the label of depression."
"Post: Everyday I wake up and get into character Do any of y’all ever feel like you get up and get into character? Like the real you isn’t conscious? I get up go to work, talk to people and say what is expected to be heard but I never say what I’m truly thinking. They ask me “how are you?” I answer back “good” quickly but don’t really think about it. I smile when I lock eyes with someone, I greet everyone enthusiastically, on the outside looking in people think I’m the happiest person but really I’m not at all. Idek if this makes sense but basically I’m just wondering if any of y’all go through or have gone through this as well?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of disconnect and disassociation, indicating a lack of authenticity in the poster's interactions with others. They describe putting on a facade and not being able to express their true thoughts and feelings. The poster also mentions feeling unhappy despite appearing happy to others. These feelings of disconnect, inauthenticity, and unhappiness are common symptoms associated with depression. The post reflects a sense of internal struggle and a desire for connection, suggesting that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression."
"Post: Things not funny anymore? Not sure if anyone else can relate to this but it seems as of late I don't laugh anymore. When I watch my favorite channels on YouTube I just sit there silently, not laughing like I used to. It's weird because these videos used to be my release but now it's a chore to just get through them."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a significant change in the poster's ability to find humor or enjoyment in things that used to bring them joy. The mention of not laughing anymore and feeling like watching their favorite YouTube channels is now a chore suggests a loss of pleasure and a decrease in motivation. These are common symptoms of depression, as it can impact an individual's ability to experience positive emotions. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of sadness and dissatisfaction, further indicating a potential depressive state."
"Post: Feeling Trapped Hello, I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18. My past 3 years of life from the ages 19-22 have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of 20 whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program. The reason my depression has returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of 6, 2 parents and 4 siblings including myself. For the past 18 years we have lived in an 1800 sq. ft. town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are 2 rooms in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about 2.5x as big as the other bedroom. Up until a few months ago when my sister moved out, all 4 of us siblings were sharing the smaller room. Now there are 3 of use sharing it, but still two bunk beds taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am 6'3"" tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom has kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and has forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pays the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lots of noise and distractions from other people and the kitchen etc. which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax. This didn't really bother me much as a kid, but now that I am 22, it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling (which was not what I intended) , I have little to no interaction with peers and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other siblings is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distractions and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel as though someone is cramming me into a box. This makes me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post. Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I don't know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loans after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse 2-3 years is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plans to move out together eventually, but that probably wouldn't happen for another 2 years minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past 6 months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at libraries during the day. I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else has been in a similar situation, please give me advice. Note: I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling trapped and expresses intense frustration and despair regarding their living situation. They describe feeling cramped, surrounded by distractions, and lacking privacy, which significantly impacts their ability to study and focus. The poster also mentions feeling extremely anxious and depressed, with thoughts of wanting to cease being conscious. This demonstrates a high level of emotional distress and hopelessness. The mention of considering spending more time at libraries and trying to engage in outdoor activities and the gym indicates an effort to cope with their situation, but the overwhelming tone of despair and the belief that staying in their current living situation is unbearable suggests significant depressive symptoms."
"Post: Why is my dad like this My brother was recently tripped in the cafeteria as a joke. It was another friend and they do it to eachother all the time, but my brother ended chipping his front tooth. The two of us go to a joint middle/high school and I really appreciated all my guy friends who went up to talk to him and ask if he was ok. Today these two guys ask me when he's going to get it fixed when I have to admit to them my dad doesn't want to take him to the dentist but rather just get him a grill. They laughed so hard. (This just seemed like a fun story to tell I didn't expect y'all to take this so seriously. My parents are separated and Im assuming that once we get to my mom's house she'll handle my brothers tooth.)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on a specific incident involving the poster's brother chipping his tooth and the reaction of their friends.

Overall, the post does not align with the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression."
Post: DAE stop telling people things because you feel like you’re a burden I’ve come to the brink of my very collapse and I refuse to say anything about it to anyone around me because it comes off as attention whoring and needy. My anxiety and depression has gotten the best of me again and I’m stuck in an endless loop of worry and self-pity. I’m closer to giving in than ever. What have I become?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of self-deprecation and feelings of being a burden to others. The poster describes reaching a breaking point and refusing to share their struggles with those around them due to a fear of being seen as attention-seeking or needy.

"Post: I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide. My whole life I’ve wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology. It’s been my dream for as long as I remember. I was going to get good grades, get my driver’s license at 16, stay in shape, eat healthy, get married, have kids, earn enough scholarships that most of my college was paid for, and get a job that I loved. Basically be the perfect woman. But now, everything seems so impossible. I’m currently failing most of my classes because I can’t find the motivation to do assignments, which causes anxiety to wrack up even more than usual. It’s just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is... nothing. I just want to be clear that the only reason I’m still on this earth is that I know suicide would crush my family. I want help, I really do, but my pride won’t let me ask. And even though I (temporarily) decided to live, the call of the peace after death still calls out to me. It reminds me of our past flirting through the angry wounds criss-crossing my arms and the knife bloodied with my own blood under my mattress. I just want, more than anything, for this pitiful excuse of an existence to end."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses feelings of hopelessness, despair, and a desire to end one's life. The poster describes a loss of motivation and an inability to find joy or fulfillment in their dreams and goals.

"Post: I want to open up and talk to you, but my brain tells me it will just make it worse if I do... That's my life in a nutshell, unfortunately. I know I need to open up and talk through any issue that may come up but in the back of my head there's a voice telling me that if I do, it will only make it worse. And the fucked up thing about it is that the voice is right 90% of the time because most people in my life don't percieve the things that bother me as actual issues. Fuck everything about communication, it only makes things worse. I honestly don't need anything else adding to the massive weight I bear."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional distress and a lack of hope or belief in the effectiveness of communication. The poster expresses a desire to open up and talk, but is overridden by a voice in their head telling them it will only make things worse. This suggests a level of self-doubt and pessimism, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster also mentions that most people in their life don't perceive their issues as actual problems, indicating a lack of social support or understanding, which can contribute to depressive feelings. The overall tone of despair, frustration, and the sense of carrying a heavy burden align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: So fucking lonely... I've been feeling so unbearably lonely lately and it feels like it's never going to end too. It doesn't make it any easier that my roommate has been sleeping with some of my best friends and the rest of my friends are all getting girlfriends and boyfriends. I've been really trying to put myself out there too which is why it's so crushing every time I see a friend of mine go on a date with someone they just met, but every time I try to ask a girl on a date she just stops responding to me....I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me and I don't know what it is!!! I really just want to die, I'm so sick of getting rejected and feeling like I'm never going to be loved."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, loneliness, and despair. The poster describes feeling unbearably lonely and expresses feelings of rejection, inadequacy, and a desire to die. The mention of their roommate sleeping with their best friends and their friends all finding romantic relationships adds to their feelings of isolation and worthlessness. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-blame, and a sense of being unlovable aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity. To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country. My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father. One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock. My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction. After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes. During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff. The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive. If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know). Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you're at)."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post shares a deeply personal and traumatic life story, including experiences of loss, family struggles, homelessness, and living in neglectful and abusive environments.

Despite the eventual positive outcome mentioned in the post, the overall tone still conveys a sense of suffering and the need to be strong in order to survive. The post also offers support and advice to others who may be experiencing similar struggles, which can be a characteristic of individuals who have lived through and overcome depression themselves.

"Post: I need a friend It's hard to put words to my feelings. I struggle with sounding serious and not coming off as an obnoxious dick. I'm sick of people coming and going and I've grown to hate myself. I don't ever act like the person I am at heart, and I never really have to anyone. I want to get out of this shell. I haven't had friends for years and I've posted here numerous times on alts and my previous account with no reply. I wouldn't be surprised if I get overshadowed by someone with much more clearly obvious issues than me like usual, but if you care, please leave a message. I hope you read this."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness, self-hatred, and a longing for connection. The poster expresses difficulty in expressing their true feelings and a fear of being perceived as obnoxious or disliked.

"Post: ""You're so good looking, how can you be depressed?"" This sounds like a humble brag, but it really grinds my gears being told this. The statement is ignorant and while it's meant as a compliment it actually makes you feel worse..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a negative emotional response and frustration towards a common statement.

"Post: It feels like my friend doesn't care about me and is rubbing it in my face So the only best friend I had planned out for weeks how she was going to do something behind my back then brag about it to me and make up stuff about what happened to make me jealous. I immediately found out that she was making stuff about it up but that kinda just made it worse. It still bothers me a lot even though it happened in July and it's still making me depressed. I sort of stopped talking to her for a few weeks but then when I felt like I could I refollowed her posts on facebook and nearly every single post is like ""I love my new best friend more than anyone else"" not even exaggerating. I tried to ignore it but there were just constant posts like that I just can't look at anything she posts anymore because some how it makes me more depressed and lowers my self image even more though it's already at zero. Should I just completely move on? I feel like never talking to her again is my only option."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional pain and distress. The poster describes feeling hurt and betrayed by their friend, and the situation has had a significant impact on their mental well-being, causing ongoing depression.

The overall tone of hopelessness and the belief that cutting off contact is the only option suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: “Best friend” didn’t invite me to celebrate 21st. I’ve been friends with this girl for over ten years. We were our first best friends. We ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college, but we never drifted too far. Yesterday, she turned 21. She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but I’m not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didn’t want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.) Today, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her. I’m pretty disappointed, hurt, and feeling lame as usual. This has been a common theme for the past couple of years. She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who I’ve known longer than her. I don’t really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon. She sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college. Is it time to take a huge step back from this friendship? I don’t feel appreciated and I feel the effort is not there. Any advice?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of disappointment, hurt, and feeling lame. The poster describes being excluded from a celebration by their best friend, which has been a common theme for the past couple of years.

"Post: DAE not tell anyone about their depression for fear of being called an attention whore? When I was a kid I was constantly getting called an attention seeker or an attention whore, mostly by the wonderful folks on r/teenagers, and know I’m not honest to anyone about my depression because I’m afraid I’ll come of as an attention whore and I don’t deserve to get help. DAE relate?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong fear of judgment and rejection, specifically a fear of being labeled an attention seeker or attention whore. This fear is a significant factor in the poster's decision to not disclose their depression to anyone and to hide their feelings.

"Post: Lifelong friend keeps lashing out So I have this friend, she's my best friend and have been forever. ?We've been friends since we were 2, we traveled the world together. We're now 25. She's been through a lot, difficult family stuff, life isn't easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling. Honestly, she needs me. Without me she'd be pretty lost and she knows it. I pretty much take the mothers role. Her mother isn't there (and usually she's more destructive than anything) and I do a lot of the stuff mothers do, including being her punching bag. Because of all of this, she tends to be very impulsive and when she's upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me, like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff, and that she wants me and everyone else to f-ck of and leave her alone, sometimes worse. It doesn't sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it's really really hard. Every time I have to tell her that it hurts me, I have to practically beg her to say sorry. Eventually she breaks down and says she's so sorry and that she can't control herself. I always forgive. The thing is I know she doesn't mean it. And also I know she's naturally impulsive. But also I don't think she's really trying to control it. I know she's got so much on her plate that it's natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything, but it's really hard for me even though I know she doesn't mean it. Right now I honestly don't feel like I want to talk to her. I think the fact I ALWAYS forgive makes her not really try to control it. She lost dozens of friends because of it but she know I will always stay. Right now I just feel like telling her that it's been one time too much (I've warned her before that eventually I might just unwillingly break), and that I can't take it. I forgave her probably over a hundred times, seriously. And I honestly care about her, and I honestly know she doesn't mean it, and I honestly worry that without me she won't be able to survive. But also I just can't stand being a punching bag anymore, it's emotionally exhausting and I feel drained. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live my life like this but I can't live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her, which really might happen."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional distress and exhaustion. The poster describes being the constant support and caregiver for their friend, but also being the target of their friend's lashing out and hurtful words. The frequent apologies and the belief that the friend doesn't mean the hurtful things they say suggests a pattern of emotional abuse. The poster expresses feeling drained, emotionally exhausted, and unsure of how to continue in this dynamic. The overall tone of despair, hopelessness, and fear of the potential consequences of ending the friendship aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Been independent since 17 I have been living with my girlfriend since I was 18 and 1 year a lone. It's so discouraging to see your friends live at home, go to school, and have a chance to fail or make mistakes. I resent them almost. I work 6 days a week and I can still bearly pay my bills. I don't get to mess up. If I fucked up I'm on the street or out of of the job. Everything is just toil toil toil, work, sleep, work. I just want a chance to be my age... I'm so tired..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a sense of discouragement, resentment, and exhaustion. The poster expresses frustration and envy towards their friends who have the opportunity to live at home, go to school, and make mistakes. This suggests a lack of fulfillment and perhaps feelings of being stuck in their current situation.

Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional distress, exhaustion, and a longing for a different lifestyle, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Is this my distorted reality? Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend. Situation One There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me. Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues... I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately. She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help. I am neither interested nor in love with her. I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help. SCENARIO TWO I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am. They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"". The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent. At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices]. But I won't disclose such details to my friends. I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship. Is there something I am not seeing here, is there a problem with how I am handling the situation well?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does contain some negative emotions and frustrations, particularly in regards to the interactions with friends and feeling misunderstood or mistreated. However, these emotions do not appear to be severe or debilitating. The poster is able to articulate their thoughts and experiences and seeks advice on how to handle these situations better. While the post indicates some disappointment and frustration, it does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, or overwhelming emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: My friends ended up voting for the other guy in the end. Should I feel betrayed or pissed? They campaigned for me and shared everything with me.

How would you feel?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a deep sense of emotional distress and confusion. The poster feels betrayed and unsure how to navigate their relationships with their friends who ended up voting for the other candidate.

"Post: I know you shouldn't need someone else to complete you but... I feel so alone and empty and the few times I've ever felt truly happy is when I'm with a guy, whether he's using me or not. Idk it's led to me getting my heartbroken a bunch, I let so many guys use me too but I guess in a weird way I was also using them? I was never really in love with any of them except for 1 and was mostly in it because I loved the idea of a relationship. I don't like being alone and I fear I'll never find someone I truly love and who loves me, leading to me living my life full of sadness and regret"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses deep emotional pain, loneliness, and emptiness. The poster indicates that they feel incomplete and that their happiness is reliant on being in a relationship with someone else, even if they are being used.

Reasoning: The post displays strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes learning that their mother has a limited amount of time left to live, which is an extremely distressing and heartbreaking situation.

The overall tone of the post is filled with sadness, helplessness, and a lack of support, which align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Why did my friend do this to me? Here is the context, this guy and I were friends for 11 years, but he works at a coffee shop full time for 40 hours a week. Also, he moved out of his parents place and lived in a condo with his 2 brothers. Every time I try to invite him, he always tells me that he's busy and that he does not have time for me, but when I see a video or a photo of him on facebook or instagram, I see him making time for his other friends, but never me, and he never invites me either. My question is why?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of confusion and hurt regarding the behavior of a friend. The poster questions why their friend consistently claims to be busy and unavailable for them, but seems to have time for other friends as shown through social media. While there is a sense of disappointment and frustration, the post does not display the depth of emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The focus is on questioning the friend's actions rather than expressing overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in activities."
"Post: Standing in the Rain Standing in the rain Letting the clouds cry your pain Your own tears don't pour No one checks in anymore A fraud seeking attention In reality you're quietly seeking intervention There's no knocks on your door No one checks in anymore Take a long walk down the lane And stand alone in the rain You hate yourself for being sick The mind's candle burning at both ends of the wick You're losing your grip on what matters,on what's sane But none of that really matters when you stand in the rain How long can you play this game Before you fall into shame and pain Who knows, so today let's just stand in the rain Because tomorrow might not be the same This is probably terrible but I've got too much free time and my mind being idle is very bad."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional pain, loneliness, and self-hatred. The poster uses vivid imagery to describe standing in the rain as a metaphor for their emotional state. They express feelings of being ignored, seeking attention but also intervention, and losing their grip on what's important and sane. The mention of hating themselves for being sick and the reference to idle time being very bad suggests a deep level of self-blame and feeling overwhelmed by their mental state. The overall tone of despair, hopelessness, and the suggestion that tomorrow might not be the same implies a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Silent friendships SOS Hello good people of Reddit, My BFF (since like kindergarten) is one of the most important people in my life and I absolutely adore her. We’re different but complimentary personalities and have always gotten along great. (She’s an INFJ Enneagram 1 and I’m an INFP enneagram 4 for reference if you’re into that kind of thing) ANYWAY, we’ve always had an issue (or at least I have) with communication. I love and value conversations with friends. She does too, but when we’re together we rarely have conversation. She doesn’t respond to a lot of my attempts to make conversation (which honestly makes me feel like an idiot, and over the top.) We recently decided to room together and it’s completely exacerbated the silence and my own insecurities. It’s hard for me to continue to update her on my life and ask for updates on hers when the conversation is so strained - and this is my main confidant, best friend in the entire world. I know she values our friendship and cares about me. She’s just quiet. And I’m insecure about that. I just don’t know how to live with the lack of conversation because I feel like there’s a lack of friendship in our quiet apartment. I really would appreciate your insights, as I want to either confront the situation - or my own issues - and make things better. I would love to hear your experiences with friends and conversation and introversion. Do you have friendships that are silent? SOS!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of frustration and insecurity regarding a lack of communication with the poster's best friend. While there is some emotional distress, such as feelings of insecurity and a desire for improvement, it does not reach the level of profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The focus of the post is on seeking advice and insights from other users, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain or numbness."
"Post: I'm afraid to be alone. People are a distraction but once they're all gone I can't help but get anxious of the idea that I am here in my room by myself with my thoughts and there is no one out there that I want to give me some closure. There is no one out there that I want because the conversations with them feel so meaningless and unhelpful. I feel aware of my mind and feel like this whole world is a distraction of some dark shit that's happening behind it all and it freaks me out and I don't know what do, I'm afraid."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post describes a fear of being alone and feeling anxious when left alone with their thoughts. The mention of wanting closure and feeling that conversations with others are meaningless and unhelpful suggests a sense of isolation and a lack of meaningful connection with others. The poster also mentions feeling aware of their mind and hyperaware of the dark thoughts or issues happening behind the distractions of the world, which causes fear and not knowing what to do. These feelings of isolation, anxiety, and fear are common symptoms of depression and suggest a significant level of emotional distress."
"Post: I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it's a step in the right direction. Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been ""concerned"" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong. Currently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I've known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I've been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends. I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me... I haven't felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I'm not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he didn't think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall. I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though... His first question was, ""what do you have to be depressed about?!"" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it's not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It's a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it's like. In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly don't think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I don't know what kept me composed today, but I'm so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could've been a completely different experience. I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster discusses their long history of depression, including experiences with hiding it and feeling misunderstood. They express feeling more miserable around their friends as they start to feel better, which suggests a lack of fulfillment or connection in those relationships. The poster also mentions feeling vulnerable and having tears welling in their eyes when discussing their depression with their friend. These signs of emotional distress, along with the positive experience of opening up about their depression, indicate a significant level of depression. The post also reflects a sense of hope and motivation, as the poster encourages others to seek help and talk about their experiences."
"Post: Bed time and the tears... Every night it is the same song and dance. We have dinner, clean up, bath, games/tv, bed. I say okay guys, wrap it up and go pee and get a sip of water it is bed time and the moans and groans begin. It continually gets worse as we go up the stairs and get to the room. I have a 4, 7, and 8 year old and they like to sleep in the same room, it is a bunk bed. My 7 year old is crying because she says she never gets to make choices and she can’t wait to be grown up and she isn’t tired, etc, etc..... My youngest becomes kind of rowdy and doesn’t know where she is going to sleep or who she will sleep with. My oldest is the best, he is actually ready for bed and just laying, waiting for the show to end. I have a steady bed time each night, around 9:15. I am open to suggestions and new ideas. I am at my wits end with the night routine. It actually makes me really sad because no matter how much I do it is never enough for my children. I truly do want them to be happy. I give them several warnings before it is bed time to make sure they are doing what they want before the nights end."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses frustration and sadness about the nightly bedtime routine with their children, there is no mention of feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, or lacking enjoyment in other areas of life. The focus of the post is seeking suggestions and new ideas to improve the bedtime routine, rather than expressing deep emotional distress."
"Post: (New York) Who's in the wrong here? I'm a little upset over a disagreement with one of my best friends that occurred in late August and has resulted in us not speaking or hanging out since. We're in college and we were out together at a party. We were talking to some random guys, and I left because I saw my ex and was talking to him. My friend texted me asking where I was and I told her I was talking to him. She told me to go to her and I said okay, and asked if he could come. Then she just said i'll just go home see you later. I was like, no don't leave alone I'll come with you without him. But she kept refusing my offer and ignored my calls when i tried to find her. When she got home she complained to my other friend that I ditched her and made her walk home alone, when I offered to go to her and tried to get to her before she left. Since then she said she was taking time for herself whatever that means and literally hasn't contacted me since. I have tried apologizing numerous times and being normal but she isn't really having any of it, and says she isn't mad at me. We haven't spoken in around 2 months now and I'm really upset because I didn't feel like I did anything wrong for one of my best friends to hold some sort of weird grudge and I miss her. Did I fuck up?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits emotions of sadness and confusion due to a disagreement with a best friend. However, these emotions do not appear to be extreme or severe enough to indicate depression. The poster primarily expresses frustration and confusion over the situation, rather than a deep sense of hopelessness or despair that is commonly associated with depression. Additionally, the focus of the post is on a specific conflict with a friend, rather than broader feelings of emotional distress."
"Post: Consequences of being hospitalized? What are the legal ramifications of being hospitalized? I’m sure it goes on some kind of record somewhere but like where and who can see it? Employers? Do I lose any rights? I shoot targets for fun a lot, it’s one of my few hobbies, but if I’m hospitalized do I lose my right to own a gun? Any other things that happen that I’m not aware of? I’ve been suicidal all week lied to my dr about it because I’m afraid to be hospitalized. But it’s getting bad, I have a hard time thinking about anything else. Help please!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains many emotional indicators that suggest the poster may be suffering from depression. The poster mentions feeling suicidal and having a hard time thinking about anything else, which indicates a profound level of distress and hopelessness. They also express fear of being hospitalized and losing rights, which can be common concerns for individuals struggling with their mental health. The reference to lying to their doctor suggests a lack of trust or discomfort in seeking help, which can be characteristic of depression. Overall, the post demonstrates significant emotional distress and a need for immediate support and assistance."
"Post: Are you a bisexual, pansexual, or queer parent? Hi! I am a graduate student in the Sociology Department at the University of California, Davis. I am conducting research on the relationship between sexual orientation and parenting strategies. There is currently a lack of research on bisexual, pansexual, and other non-monosexual identities, particularly as they relate to the family.

"Post: Hello out there.... Ugh. I battle with depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and some physical health issues. Not so sure about battle right now. Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with? I'm 42. I've never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years, and that was just once. A few times (I think) I've made it to the 2 year mark with a company. 1 year is a bit easier. I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder. (I lost 40% of my starting weight in about 7 months, before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome.) Right now I'm in the initial hurry up and deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability. Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house, so at least I'm not homeless. (TBH, most of the time she's out of the country, and when she is here, she's just as selectively social as I am.) Because of waiting to get on disability, I'm off my medicine. I can't even afford the cheapest ACA insurance, and even if I had that, I couldn't afford the copays for my medicine. I'm not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI/SSDI. I'm not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho. This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I've ever had. It's not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it's just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life. I sleep as late as I can every day, (usually until around 1 or so), hang out in bed playing games, reading, or watching videos, and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening. I don't feel like I'm living anymore. I'm just in a holding pattern. I think back to what my life was like, even 8 months ago, and I mourn for it. At least I'm not suicidal. I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind. Thanks for sticking around to the end of the post."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a multitude of emotional indicators that align with very severe depression. The poster openly discusses battling depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and physical health issues, indicating a complex and challenging mental health profile. They express a lack of fulfillment and purpose in life, describing their current state as a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life and feeling like they are just in a holding pattern. They mention sleeping excessively, engaging in unproductive activities in bed, and feeling a sense of mourning for their previous life. While they note that they are not currently suicidal, the overall tone of the post demonstrates a deep sense of hopelessness and despair."

I just want to ducking die."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a high level of emotional distress, self-deprecation, and hopelessness. The poster expresses feeling like a ""piece of shit"" and believes they will never be enough for anyone. The mention of wanting to die suggests a severe level of emotional pain and despair.

"Post: Browsing r/nostalgia was a mistake Looking through that sub just makes me cry.

It never did."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of sadness and regret. The poster describes feeling emotional and crying when looking through a subreddit dedicated to nostalgia, suggesting a strong emotional response to the passage of time and feelings of missed opportunities.

"Post: Why me Ive been letting myself get played and led on by the same girl. I know its going to happen everytkme but everytime fall even harder for her. Right now everything hurts, i just don't want to feel anymore. Im tired of this pain called life. Death seems like my only way to not feel at all"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a deep sense of emotional pain and despair. The poster describes feeling continuously played and led on by the same girl, and acknowledges that this pattern is likely to happen again, yet still falls even harder for her every time.

"Post: I Feel Lonely and Scared I'll End Up Friendless. Need an Ear. Ive come to the realization that I'm really scared I'll end up with no friends. I used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years. But, I have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend I had in high school. The new ones I made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group (since sophomore year. I'm a 2nd semester junior.). But every friend group has their faults. And with this one, I don't feel like I fit in completely. 4 out of the 7 of them are know-it-alls who will try to correct you on every little thing (like one time I was exaggerating and saying somewhere had 100x more people, and one of them came out of their room and said ""Um, I think it's actually 1000x more people."") Those 4 are also really uptight, don't get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they're always trying to school me on what's appropriate (MIND YOU I NEVER JOKE ABOUT RACE OR OPPRESSED GROUPS OR ANYTHING OFF LIMITS LIKE THAT.). I just don't always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected. There's also one I don't even like that much (no matter how much I've tried) because she has an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, my-way-or-highway attitude. The point is I don't always feel in sync with them. Even the ones I do feel in sync with, I don't feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as I reach out them (when we're not in school). And I don't like one-sided friendships. I'm worried we won't stay friends after undergrad. Also this year, 2 of them are graduating and I have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot that'll be in my room. I'll admit, I didn't make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm, and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it's harder to make friends now with the people at my school. I don't know what to do. Part of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place, and trying to join this friend group when it was already established. They eventually came to see me as a member, and we've had good times but I don't know that these are ""my people"". And part of me wants to get a single room next year, but I feel like I'll just be jumpstarting my social isolation and I'm also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics. Tl;dr - I've lost touch/outgrown my high school friends, don't fit in with my college friends, and am scared to end up alone without any friends. Need advice."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays a sense of loneliness, fear, and dissatisfaction with current friendships. The poster expresses concerns about fitting in with their college friend group, feeling unappreciated and disrespected, and worries about maintaining these friendships after graduating. They also mention their own lack of effort in making friends outside of their dorm and express anxiety about finding a new roommate. While these feelings can be indicative of some level of emotional distress, they do not reach the level of profound hopelessness or despair commonly associated with very severe depression. The poster is seeking advice and expressing a desire for guidance, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain."
"Post: I start my first job tommorow I've been a lurker here for a long time. I'm 19 m, and I somehow finally got motivated enough to apply for and somehow qualify for a job. College has been really up and down for me, but somehow something good happened for once. Idk I just wanted to share, I'm super nervous but I thought some of you might be able to relate to how much this simple thing means to me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a mix of emotions, including nervousness and excitement, but also expresses a deep sense of significance and relief in being able to start their first job. The mention of college being ""up and down"" hints at potential struggles or difficulties in the past. The poster also seeks validation and understanding by sharing their accomplishment and connecting with others who may relate to their experience. While the emotional indicators of depression may not be as strong in this post as in the first example, the mention of past struggles and the significance placed on this one positive event suggest that the poster may be experiencing mild to moderate depressive symptoms."
"Post: Cousin I’ve not seen for 25+ years trash talking me to my son (sorry long post) I just need a rant and maybe some advice on what to tell my son. My youngest son (15) came home last night and said he was invited to a party this weekend and could he go, after all the ‘mum checks’ I gave permission. He then proceeded to tell me that the mum of his friend ‘hates me and that I hate her’ and I found this odd as I don’t particularly hate anyone and certainly not one of his acquaintances mums. It turns out that she is a cousin of mine who I haven’t seen for 25+ years since the death of our grandfather, her father accused me of stealing my grandads Home and contents, not true but I did care for my grandfather at his home, that I bought, and my grandfather lived rent (and bill) free for 2 years prior to his death. When he passed away, my uncle said he wanted things from the home for himself (I had no issue with that) and when my uncle (this lady’s dad) said he wanted the TV I said he could take the rent book for it too (my grandad rented it from a local place). My uncle was pissed but accepted that it was rented. I also put into boxes all the things my grandad had willed my aunts and uncles for them to take away after the funeral - some couldn’t bear to and I put it in storage for them to take at a later date. Now I’ve lived in my home since then and over the years changed the house to my taste and extended it. Unbeknownst to myself (until last night) each time I changed something my uncle has bad mouthed me to other family members and run me down, convincing others that I stole the house from them (was a rental property when my grandfather moved in and it was myself who purchased it). Over the years I have noticed that my family are not very communicative with me but I’ve put it down to initially my brothers death (4 years after my grandad) and then my mums (a few years later). But after speaking to others in the family last night I’ve discovered what has been said about me. Now I don’t particularly give a damn about what’s said about me but I am upset that my cousin has told my son that I hate her, he is autistic and things like this stick in his head. Last night I just said something like ‘I don’t know the lady how can I hate her? And is that something you think I would do?’ To which he agreed that it wasn’t something I’d say/do. My problem is the party, the parents are going to be there (one of the reasons I’m allowing him to go) and I’m concerned that they will trash talk me to him and how do I explain to him that some people just believe what they want regardless of what the truth is? I don’t want to give him all this information before he goes as it’s not really a problem unless my cousin makes it one, of you see what I mean. Thank you if you made it this far and any advice would be appreciated."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses frustration and anger towards their cousin for trash-talking them, as well as a deep sense of betrayal and hurt. They also mention feeling upset and concerned about their son being influenced by these negative opinions. The overall tone of the post is weighed down by sadness, disappointment, and a sense of powerlessness in the face of the situation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Trying to make me jealous I once asked some friends about where they get one of their ""items"" and they both seemed to shrug it off, laugh and basically show that they don't want me to know. I thought wow ok didn't expect it from friends but I guess some people are petty about some things. And they knew that it got to me a little that they didn't tell me but whatever. Now they would bring up the topic of this ""item"" here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it. I have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their ""dominant"" position. They probably get a kick out of it. The problem is, I don't know the best way to react to it when it's brought up in convo to show that I'm not envious or jealous. And I'm not jealous of it at all as I actually found out what I needed to through other means, it just bugs me that they think it does and so I don't want to give off that vibe so they can go into a private convo and laugh about it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits emotional indicators of depression, particularly feelings of rejection, hurt, and suspicion. The poster describes feeling upset and surprised by their friends' behavior and the perceived effort to make them jealous. They express a lack of understanding and frustration about how to react in a way that doesn't show envy or jealousy. There is a sense of insecurity and a desire to avoid being the subject of ridicule or mockery by their friends. While the intensity of emotional distress may not be as severe as in the first example, the overall tone and content of the post do suggest a level of emotional struggle and sensitivity."
"Post: I'm not worth it I just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone. I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired. My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made) and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life. She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.) I feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere. I really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a profound sense of worthlessness, self-blame, and pessimism, which are common indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling like a burden to others and believes that their presence only brings negativity and ruin to their family's life. They express a deep belief that their own existence is worthless and that their absence would ultimately have a positive impact on those around them. The mention of being too lazy and stupid to take their own life indicates a lack of self-esteem and hopelessness. The poster also mentions hoping for a serious medical issue to naturally resolve their situation, suggesting a desire to escape their current circumstances. Overall, the post reflects significant emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I lost my father recently, and now I have less suicidal thoughts This isn't gonna be what you think it's gonna be. If you read the title you're probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues. He was not, I loved him very dearly. I am extremely sad he passed away while I'm in such a young age (I'm 21) but c'est la vie I guess.. The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it's expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this didn't quite help. I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery. Now I just slate the days away, it's hard, but there's no other option for me right now.."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of sadness and loss due to the recent passing of the poster's father. They acknowledge feeling extremely sad and the impact it has had on them, but also express a resignation or acceptance of their situation. However, the key indicator of depression in this post is the mention of suicidal thoughts. The poster states that they have become less likely to commit suicide because they cannot do that to their mother, expressing a sense of guilt and responsibility towards her. This indicates a significant struggle with their mental health and the presence of depressive symptoms. Additionally, the mention of financial difficulties and feeling trapped with no other option adds to the overall distress and despair conveyed in the post."
Post: Just feeling very isolated right now. It's one of those situations where all I want is for someone to realize I'm drowning. All I want is to be offered a hand up... To feel like I actually matter to someone. I recently lost what I would consider to be my last friend IRL and haven't been out of the house for any reason other than work in weeks. The person I call a best friend is a person I've known less than six months who lives half way across the country. I've been waiting around hours hoping he will ask me for a phone call. He hasn't. And I don't want to continually pester him since he hasn't offered me a phone call tonight. I don't really know why I'm posting in this group. I guess so maybe I can imagine that someone somewhere will read my current thoughts and maybe I won't feel quite so alone.

My parents sold their house and have not yet decided where to live. They are 65 and 70 and are retired. We own a small apartment building and live in it and rent the units. My parents will have some cash and also have monthly income, but my brother appears to be very depressed, may also have some untreated medical issues, and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs (not pain pills, but Xanax &amp; Ativan? Not sure). He seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job, which is doing over other people's houses as a contractor. He owns his own truck and tools. My parents are worried they'll ""lose"" him when they move if he doesn't move with them, but nobody knows what to do or what his real problem(s) are. Is it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brother's ""rent"" by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry and/or other requirements? Has anyone done this? Is there another sub that is better for these types of questions? I don't know if anyone knows what to do anymore. My mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist, though he is very manipulative and secretive so I don't know what to do or if anything else can be done and I am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internist--he's very deceptive.

While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us.

"Post: I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about. Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation: About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career. I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good). Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility. I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same. Sorry for the long read."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several signs of severe depression.

"Post: I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like ""Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..."" I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys. And I know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives, but there are people who were born 5 years before me (who are real, yes) and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things. Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky. I want to go do something fun and amazing, but knowing I've wasted so many years being depressed in bed, on my computer, sleeping, and just doing nothing will haunt me forever.

"Post: Family problems Hello, I want to talk about things in my household now, and maybe get some opinions on it. Okay, so my sister is 22, she's the oldest. I'm 14, the middle child, and my brother who's 12 is the youngest. Our dad works abroad and comes back a few times a year. But we talk on phone almost everyday. My sister studies in a university and comes back usually on weekends and then maybe some other days depending on her schedule. When she comes back everyone in the house starts fighting and she's the problem. When she's home, everything we do is wrong. We were ""raised"" wrong. Mom ""spoils"" us. Mom doesn't ""love"" her. We ""don't want her here"". And when my mom says that she causes the problems she bursts into tears, goes to her room, cries for a bit and leaves to her boyfriends house because ""she feels loved there"". And that's how it always goes. She comes back, says that my brother doesn't do anything in this is house and that he's a spoiled brat, fights over something, bursts into tears and leaves. She is very emotional. When she accuses my brother of something and he calls her some kind of name she immediately stars crying like it's the end of the world. Last night she texted my mom, saying that she raised us poorly and that mom doesn't love her. She said that she's gonna be leaving our home and won't come back because ""we don't want her there"". Of course, me, as the peace maker in the family, wrote her a huge message about how she is wrong, how we actually love her is just that she doesn't see it and everything else. She wrote back, about how I'm wrong, about how my brother is spoiled and again, everything else. I will agree, my brother is the youngest and he can be a brat. But that's the point, he's the youngest. And I don't see how you can make a problem out of everything. Like dude chill oml you're not dying. Guys, how the hell do we make her understand.

"Post: How to disown my sister How do I remove my 18 year old sister from the family? I’m her younger brother (16) and all my life my sister has been nothing but manipulative towards my parents. The main issue is when she turns my mom and Dad against each other, resulting in her being free to do whatever while our parents scream at each other, leading to my mom crying or then separating for a few days. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, which is why I’m taking into serious consideration of kicking her out of our family. I understand my sister means a lot to me so it won’t be easy but her behavior have made my mom cry more times than I can count. Unfortunately, my parents are also very soft on her so they will not go along with me trying to disown her.

"Post: Feeling numb I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: My bestie guilt trips me constantly My best friend moved to the other side of Canada. Anyone who knows anything about North American geography knows that Canada is effing huge and so it's expensive to travel that far west. I've planned a really awesome solo backpacking trip to Southeast Asia. Five countries in 13 weeks. Anyway, when she found out, she was pissed I'm not spending that money on going out to see her instead. And she said something like ""if I had any extra cash I'd be using it to come see you""... Which makes me feel like absolute crap. She clearly doesn't understand wanderlust... I wanna see other cultures and it's just not the same to travel within your own country.

Post: You know what i realised? I cant really get to sleep at all and have been doing alot of thinking. I just realised that i am in control. The thought of this makes me really happy.

"Post: Does anyone actually feel a little better with the recent Trump/Putin headlines? I live in rural Trump country and work at a gas station. Suddenly nobody wants to talk politics, and my regulars and coworkers have starting acting more civil toward me.

"Post: People are NOT who they seem. I originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I'm saying is, **don't** trust anybody. You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you're around are really nice and fine towards you when your back's turned. I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too! ""Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)."" ""You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son. He can't survive without you. He'll burn all the money with booze. He'll be homeless and sleep on the streets."" Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I don't even drink. Jesus Christ.

Suddenly, I'm back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it's trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I'm pushing it back. I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT. I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me. Jesus. For now, I'm playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I'll be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade.

Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ?

I rarely use tinder because I don't match with many people, I'm below average looking like but it doesn't help swiping for ages and rarely getting a match.

"Post: Friend dumps problems on me and that’s all we do together now Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions! Have been friends with a woman for a few years. Started off fun, we’d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text. For the last 6 months she’s stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. She’ll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, won’t stop talking when I need to go and will call even if I’ve said I’ll be out or unavailable. I got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems. She gets aggressive if I don’t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where she’s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didn’t mean it how it came across she will say I don’t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. She’ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesn’t give her the result she wanted! It’s confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now I’m left with her constantly calling. If I don’t pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls. Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing. Would you say anything or just cut ties given how sensitive she seems?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Is it bad that I am kind of mad my friend never follows my advice? The friend in question and I have been friends for over 7 years and best friends for the last 3 years and have shared just about every detail of our life. I am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years. The heading is a bit misleading here. I am not mad at her that she doesn’t follow my advice. Rather, I am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life. I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she can’t seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesn’t just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind. I know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you can’t follow that super easily and I have been trying very hard to be as supportive as I can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on. But it’s also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem. And it seems like she isn’t learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people. And it also makes me very anxious when I constantly worry about her. But I don’t want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions.

"Post: Really struggling with self image - any tips to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for as long as I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I've continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now. I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child) The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I'm reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I'm not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I'm happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I've literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail. In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we're together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I'm so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through. Any thoughts on this are appreciated and thankyou to anyone who took the time to read this."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of self-image struggles and low self-confidence.

"Post: Long text, I just want an audience. Why haven’t I killed myself yet? It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can. Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty. I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? I give up. I just want to die. P.S. Fuck people who say they’re afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you? P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It’s fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so that’s really more on me than on them) PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE I just want to die. Please just kill me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: How does one cope with not talking with anyone for the longest time? I am lonely but there's nothing I can do to have friends at the moment 😔 My friends have mostly been away or busy with their own lives.

"Post: I am lost. I do not know what to do. Hey guys. This is my first post here, I made this account because I need to vent and I have no one else to listen to me. To an outsider, my life seems okay: I am married to a great guy, I have a good job that pays well, my family is healthy and I have friends. To me, my life is unbearable. I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day. One of my main problems is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggles with low self esteem. I have gained about 15 lbs in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I can't seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc... Each and every day, I fail. This kills me. My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy. I am a lazy, unmotivated person who is notorious for making excuses for herself. I really need some guidance. I hate waking up. I hate getting out of bed. I do not even want to shower or function.

"Post: Tomorrow the world will go on like always I've never been here... this wasn't a part of ""the plan"" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything. I have lived 20 years by myself, no relationships, no close friends, and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out. I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I don't know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it's not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I can't even understand and the repetition of ""I'm okay"" is getting old. I've tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it's left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I've tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I can't handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe isn't ignorance but overthinking, I hope... Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity. There is much to be said but this will probably find its own void. I'm dreaming of a different world, but the oblivion of what I don't know plagues me. I leave my love and peace here, may you find yours.

"Post: My parents let me drink For anyone wondering what happens to the kids whos parents let them drink at home because ""they need to learn"" or ""better in front of me"" this is basically what it did to me.

I wrote this apology that I can’t bring myself to send them. I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone. When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didn’t really speak to anyone. He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole. I didn’t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before. While it was true it wasn’t the reason I wasn’t speaking to anyone. Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come. I did anyway and you can imagine that didn’t end well at all. He won’t talk to me. I finally found the courage to type up this apology. It explains the conditions I suffer from, how they’re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them. The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can. Nobody knows the things I went through but I’m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves. Please don’t judge me too harshly I just don’t want this family member to never talk to me again. I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise it’s not. Here it is : I just wanted to let you how sorry I am. I should’ve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time. I’d like to fully explain myself. This is really long but it’s genuine. And I’m not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that I’ve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened. Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what I’m about to say. Some of this won’t make any sense initially. But trust me it all ties together. Whatever decision you make I’d prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff. This is why I handled certain things the way I did. I’ve been through a lot of trauma. Initially it was with Savannah’s dad. He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone. And she was aware and didn’t do anything. This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together. Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents. His mom didn’t want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me. She’d give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc. My dad wasn’t any better as he gave me my first black eye. School was really difficult as I’d get bullied pretty bad and I’d get myself suspended just to avoid it. At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didn’t need. His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back. After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014. I was 15 at this point. She promised me a better life but it only got worse. She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didn’t want me improving and losing the SSI. Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic. He’d break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me. Taunt me about how I’ve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how he’d kill me but he figured I’d do it myself anyway. I’ve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me. Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people aren’t aware of a lot of the things I’m telling you right now. Because of some of these conditions it’s hard for me to socialize with people for the first time. I wasn’t trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and I’m sorry. It’s something I’m trying to work on. In fact it was so bad at one point I wasn’t even able to eat in a restaurant. I couldn’t open the door if I ordered food. I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with I’d think of the worst possible scenario. It’s even preventing me from getting a license. Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody? If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it would’ve sounded like bs. And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never should’ve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that. Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldn’t have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left. The spoiled meat story was true it wasn’t a lie. I ate it around 1 in the morning she didn’t give it to me I wasn’t"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I News Your advice Hi, I’m 18. my mom passed away three years ago, now I live with my dad who’s a wonderful dad and I really love him but there’s this situation that I don’t know how to handle : He got involved into a sex club or something like 50 shades of gray, I don’t know exactly what it is but I know that many women send him naked pictures and he is like a master, he tortures them sexually and they accept. I know he’s been involved with that for a long time, even when he was married with my mom, but he doesn’t know I know all that. One day I asked him to answer me sincerely what was that, or just say nothing if he didn’t want to. He lied to me but I said nothing.

"Post: Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for ""all of us"" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we'd all be one big happy family. Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying ""absolutely not"". Maybe it's my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks. It's be really easy if her MIL wasn't a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I've ever met. She's always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We're there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there's the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested doesn't work. Anyone else have family that has tried this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses discomfort and disagreement with the idea of living in a multi-family and multi-generational household. The poster values independence, privacy, and the ability to make their own choices, which is contrary to the proposed living arrangement.

The tone remains pragmatic and does not display the emotional indicators typically associated with depression."

Gee, thanks, teacher! Even though I even said it out loud and personally told you, you STILL INSIST on making me feel like shit. Giving me a C because I didn't do one assignment is not enough, is it?

"Post: My life is so hollow Stupid self pitying rant, sorry. Nobody cares about my existence. I’ve never been and can’t get into a relationship. I’m stuck in this isolated suburb for the next 3 years of my life, drifting between my school and home. Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life i’m going to have once i’m free, but recently i’ve been having to do more school work (i’m used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently i’ve been having to actually work to compete with my peers) and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is. Nothing feels authentic when i’m here. There have been beautiful times in my life and 90% of them are when i’ve been abroad. I just feel so genuinely empty whenever I give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated I am from people and the world. And as a person who truly appreciates the beauty of human beings and life, this really hurts me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Can/Should I send her a dm? Hi I‘ll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band. Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that. After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I‘d follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized: I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I‘ll stop here). I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive: Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city. I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and won’t say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music. I know you don’t know me and I don’t know you, but if you want to talk to someone who comprehend what you are feeling, I would gladly do it.

"Post: I Want to Scream Until It Stops and the World Makes Sense Again (update) A few good days had me fooled into thinking I had control over myself and my life. The only thing holding back from suicide is my mother and how much killing myself would fuck her up.

"Post: Why am I an idiot? I always feel the need to be loved by someone else. So I am constantly trying to talk to a girl and get a date. I actually went on a date recently. A couple weeks ago I hit it off with this girl from another school nearby and we had a lot in common. We vibed really well and seemed to have similar feelings for each other. We talked for a couple of weeks and then we went on a date. I think we both enjoyed ourselves but we didn’t talk as often afterwards. I blame myself for that because I feel like I should have been more social with her. We don’t talk anymore and I wish I still talked to her but it has been a weird amount of time since our date and I don’t know how to go about it. When I finally get a chance to have a girlfriend like I feel I need, I fuck it up.

"Post: I've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird. But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure. Edit: I also don't mean to brag or anything like that. I just wanted to share this with someone, and was wondering if someone had a similar experience maybe in forming a bond with their parents longer into adulthood."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses resentment towards their mother for being emotionally abusive during their childhood, indicating a history of negative experiences that have contributed to their depression.

"Post: Making friends... Literally one of the hardest things ever. If you haven't found a group in middle school, you literally have to make friends with everyone in the group. And then, entertain them and convince them you're interesting for literally a year on end. Then, I imagine you have a shot of getting invited somewhere. I'm not a fucking magician, I can't keep you entertained consistently for that long. And these people never reciprocate the effort you put in because they have a group and you don't. I gotta work 10 times as hard because I didn't get lucky in middle school like these guys... lol..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Apologise and make up or move on? Sorry it’s long, but I really need advice. I’m a girl and he’s a gay guy so there’s definitely no feelings other than friendship. He only invites me to clubs occasionally, never to hang out. I felt used &amp; that he only invites me to pay for his drinks. Most of the time he ditches me to go off with random guys. One night I was going home early and he said ‘no you’re staying at mine tonight’, but within half an hour met some guy and said he was going home with him instead- and that didn’t even end up happening because the guy had a boyfriend, so he ditched me for no reason. He doesn’t even text me, because apparently he’s a bad communicator. On the flip side he constantly refers to me as ‘one of his best friends’, tells me he loves me and wants me to be his maid of honour one day. He had a potential STI scare recently and asked if I’d go to the clinic with him. I ran out of my house and across the city to sit with him for 4 hours, didn’t even have time to brush my teeth! While we were waiting I told him this was the first time we’ve hung out outside of a club, and he said ‘it’s not my fault I’m busy’. I didn’t show it but I was really disappointed. He’s a student (as am I), not the president. He hangs out with his other friends constantly, stays at their house for a week at a time OR MORE, but has the nerve to tell me he’s too busy for me. A week later he invited me to the club again and we left and walked to the bus stop together. He got on his bus and left me alone and drunk, again. It’s also strange because he’d always invite me to stay at his after nights out, but that randomly stopped a couple of months ago. Anyway, this time I had enough and ignored his messages after that. He then invited me to the cinema and I said yes. On the day I saw that he was with his other friends instead. He called me at night and said he was ‘tired and sick’ but we could meet 2 days later. I just said ‘ok’ because I didn’t want to confront him and fall out. On the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked ‘are you still up for the cinema?’ and following advice from my friends, I said ‘no thanks’ and told him it’s unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said he’s not busy, he’s just a shit friend. He said he agrees that I’m a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and he’s trying his best. He said he was making an effort to match his actions to his words by spending time with me alone. I didn’t reply. It’s been 4 days and we haven’t spoken since. He’s been with his other friends the whole time and frankly I don’t think he’s bothered. I know it sounds dramatic but I’ve barely slept since. I’m only getting 3 hours of sleep a night and I’m really sad and can’t stop thinking about the situation. I thought we were gonna be friends forever. I love him and want him in my life but everyone says I’ve given him too many chances. I’ve been thinking about apologising and making up, if nothing else at least just so I can feel better and start sleeping again. But I don’t know how it will be received or if anything will change. I don’t know what to do but this situation is killing me and I regret causing it in the first place. If anyone has even read this, thank you"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a range of emotions including feelings of hurt, disappointment, rejection, and sadness. The poster describes feeling used and ditched by their friend, experiencing disappointment and sadness over their friend's behavior, and expressing a desire for the friendship to continue despite feeling unsure if it will change.

"Post: Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it. But I just feel really stuck."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does exhibit some emotional distress and frustration with the relationship, but it does not reach the level of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of hurt, disappointment, and anger towards their best friend and describes a sense of one-sidedness in the relationship. While there is some mention of anxiety and fear of losing the friend, there is not a pervasive sense of hopelessness or despair. The tone of the post suggests a desire to address the issue and have a rational conversation rather than a deep sense of emotional pain."
"Post: My latest depression has a cure, and it's my girlfriend. So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months. TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that's right, I do think it's marvelous). But for some important reason that I don't wanna give details in, we can't be together anymore. So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it. Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me. We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff. Here's what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her. I'm a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I'm keeping with is my girlfriend. She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive. Here's the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I'm not with her. I know we'll be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple indications of severe depression. The poster describes experiencing severe depression and anxiety, which have led to anxiety attacks and feelings of their world being like hell. The poster expresses a deep dependence on their girlfriend for their happiness and overall well-being, stating that she is their ""everything"" and the only desire they crave in the world. This level of emotional dependence and belief that their life is meaningless without their girlfriend suggests a significant level of emotional distress and an unhealthy reliance on external factors for their own self-worth. The overall tone of the post conveys deep sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of fulfillment, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
"Post: I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously. I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded. Gone. Zilch. Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward. I hate people so fucking much. I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor. I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated. I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend isn't homeless and isn't living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend. I am so tired."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling a sense of despair, hopelessness, and exhaustion in their interactions with customers at their job. They express hatred towards people and frustration with their actions, indicating significant emotional distress and a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in their work. The poster also mentions self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and personal struggles outside of work, such as the homelessness of a loved one. These factors, combined with the overall tone of weariness and pretending to be okay, indicate a profound level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I think I am depressed but I am not sure I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but I think I might have depression. 1) I love going out with friends. I am very active person, but lately for example even when I am laughin I suddenly stop and get very sad. I do not know what is wrong but I get very sad and I lose interest in doing everything. 2) Lately I can not focus. I have never been fun of doing homework but I was always doing it. Now I just can't I am just laying bad instead of doing homework. You might say I am been lazy but also I am music producer and I absolutely love music, but lately I just can't. When I sit down I just can't focus on it and I end up going to bad after 15 minutes. 3) I am sleepy all the time and I am sad most of the times. I do not have specific reasons but I am. 4) I became very insecure. It feel like my friend do not like me. I feel like they do not want me to be around them and I just do not know why. 5) Most of the times on weekdays I am just laying on my bad and listening sad music and I feel like I am wasting my time. Sorry I think I do not make any sense at all but rn I am feeling really bad and can't think properly."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several key indicators of depression. The poster expresses a sudden shift in mood, going from enjoyment and laughter to intense sadness. This is accompanied by a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, such as going out with friends and pursuing music production.

Overall, the post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress, lack of interest, and negative thoughts, all of which are consistent with symptoms of depression."
"Post: What’s wrong with me? I have an amazing family and an incredible group of friends. The support is there and they’ve tried to help in the past but I can’t burden them with my troubles anymore, it just feels uncomfortable. I’ve seen a three therapists in my life each no more than two times. I’m not sure why I can’t just get myself to keep seeing one consistently. I’m waiting on grades from summer school but I’m fairly positive I failed and will subsequently be kicked out of college. I’m 23 and still have over year left to go. I don’t know where to turn. I don’t know how to move forward. I can’t sleep at night and during the day all I want to do is lay in bed. My productivity is at an all time low which is saying something, trust me. I feel like I’ve lost it. I think I hate myself."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of self-doubt, despair, and hopelessness. The poster feels burdened by their troubles and uncomfortable sharing them with others, indicating a lack of support network. The mention of seeing multiple therapists but being unable to continue with consistent therapy shows difficulty in seeking help and maintaining treatment. The fear of academic failure and potentially being kicked out of college adds to the overwhelming stress and sense of despair. The inability to sleep, lack of productivity, and wanting to stay in bed all day suggest a significant disruption to the poster's daily functioning. The statement ""I think I hate myself"" reflects a negative self-perception and self-esteem issues commonly associated with depression. The overall tone and content of the post indicate a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
