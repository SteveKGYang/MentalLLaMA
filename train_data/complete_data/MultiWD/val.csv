We‚Äôre all gonna die one day, might as well die sooner if it‚Äôs to end misery. Life sucks. And it‚Äôs never gonna get better. At least for me it won‚Äôt, I‚Äôve been hoping and dreaming of a day where I can feel even an ounce of happiness but it doesn‚Äôt ever come. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve felt like I deserved what I had. It‚Äôs been a long time since I had a real laugh and actually felt happy. I just..have no one. I‚Äôm alone..I hate myself and everything is so stressful right now. I need a break...I want to run away from everything and just start new. But I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone..all I do is hurt other people. I enter there lives and it seems like all I do is mess them up. They don‚Äôt think so..they don‚Äôt even know I think so. Everything is just so confusing and I can‚Äôt think or feel right anymore. My thoughts are getting stronger and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can hold back. I‚Äôm gonna break."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the emotional wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","yes.

While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late.

She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

575,"Post: I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it. It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the emotional wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","yes.

1072,"Post: Everything is falling or has fallen apart. My dad killed himself several years ago because my mom left him for some douchebag with money. My dog followed three months later. I got an incurable STD from someone I trusted but shouldn't have. Ive lost my license, and my car. Im trapped in a dead end janitorial job that Ive been maxed out in for the last 3 years. My spare income goes towards weed, so I can keep myself blithe and functional. All I can do is go to work in a few hours and pretend everything is cool. Nothing will ever change. I'll always be poor. I'll always be lonely, I'll always be depressed. The woman I've been talking to is married, and on top of it, I think is close to dumping me for another side guy. I could be imagining that.
