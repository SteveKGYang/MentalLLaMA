I see my counselor regularly, I‚Äôm on Zoloft and Wellbutrin, trying to work on daily meditations and CBT. But nothing seems to be working. I haven‚Äôt felt like myself in such a long time and I‚Äôm not even sure of who I was before this. Was I ever happy? Confident? Did I have goals? I wish I had something more meaningful to say, but if I keep going it‚Äôll just be a novel of negativity. I don‚Äôt really know what I can find here, but I‚Äôm running out of ideas and desperately need to be reassured that I‚Äôm not just another face in the crowd. It feels selfish and stupid to admit, but I need someone to tell me that my existence is significant. God, it‚Äôs embarrassing to feel so powerless and incompetent."," Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1.

Reasoning: 1. The post expresses frustration towards a subreddit (the ""sub"" mentioned in the post) and criticizes its existence, implying a belief that the subreddit does not provide appropriate help or support. This suggests that the individual may not perceive themselves as a burden to others, as they are focusing on the inadequacy of the support they believe others are receiving.

2. The post mentions that the individual has gone through a difficult phase in their life and has received professional help from a psychologist. This indicates that they have sought and received assistance for their own mental well-being, which suggests a level of self-awareness and proactivity in managing their mental health.

"Post: 2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away, not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it. I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step, being medication, has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure. In hindsight, it's really no different than taking a medication for any other illness and in order to get better I think this is something I have to do.

"Post: Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past. I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning. Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... Now, here comes the real problem... A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook. Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day.

"Post: What I mean by this, is that they care to hear how you're doing and stuff, and they do care of your existence.

"Post: I normally work out a lot but last year was so bad I even cancelled my gym membership. This year I actually started working out again and when I noticed I had started making some progress I made myself a goal to gain 10 kg this year (since I had lost some weight last year). Today is the last day of the year and this morning the scale showed that I've gained exactly 10kg! I also know that almost all of it is muscle mass, so this is the fittest I've ever been. I just wanted to share this here because I actually felt really good about this, which is a feeling I very rarely experience nowadays. The thing is though now when I got home after NYE I don't feel this happiness at all anymore. I actually feel more alone and miserable than I've felt in weeks."," Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: 1.

Reasoning: This post does show signs of risk of thwarted belongingness. Here's the reasoning:

1. The individual mentions having had run-ins with counselors in the past, indicating a history of mental health struggles and potentially seeking help for them. Their parents' negative reaction and dismissal of their struggles, claiming they are just seeking attention, suggests a lack of support and understanding from their primary social group (family). This lack of support and invalidation can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and disconnectedness.

2. The individual expresses dissatisfaction with their academic performance and mentions reaching out to a teacher for help. This suggests a potential feeling of inadequacy and failure in their academic environment, which could further contribute to their sense of disconnectedness and lack of belonging.

3. The individual expresses a desire to avoid their parents knowing anything about their struggles, going as far as considering giving a fake phone number to their counselor. This desire to hide their true feelings and experiences from their parents indicates a lack of trust and open communication within their familial relationships, which can further exacerbate their sense of thwarted belongingness.

Overall, the post shows clear interpersonal risk factors of mental disturbance, including a lack of support from family, dissatisfaction with academic performance, and the desire to hide their struggles from their parents. These factors contribute to the individual's risk of thwarted belongingness."

Being truly alone is more painful and impactful than imaginable for most. I am now bitter and fed up with myself and everyone. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I cant do anything at all without feeling terrible. I cant think anymore my mind is blank I want to take a sledge hammer to my head just to see what's in there. Thatd be stupid though. I don't see a future for myself. I wish it didn't all happen like this, I feel like I never had a chance. abused in childhood never loved by anyone and jealous of everyone who isn't grateful that they're loved and appreciated. My mind is gone, any chances I had are gone at this point, socially I will never be successful and so what's the point? Youre depressed yeah just tell your friends and family they love you and want you happy! My family wont help me I dont have the means to help myself. My brain is fucking mush.

I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that I‚Äôm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I don‚Äôt think thats possible.

"Post: Hey guys, I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me. I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try. At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor.

It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down.

"Post: So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine.

I have a fear of commitment, and committing to that decision is something I just can‚Äôt do. Several times everyday, I daydream about someone walking up to me and killing me. If someone else did it for me, it would make things so much better. Ironically, this makes me want to self harm, but self harming itself has left me with scars that make me feel worse about myself which, in turn, makes me want to end my life or self harm more.
