"Post: I'm 29 years old and here I am another New Year's Eve with my parents. So it's thirtieth time that I'm spending my New Year's Eve with my parents. They are old and tired dad is 60yo and mom is 58yo and I'm also so tired of everything I never had any true friends, never had girlfriend, finished crappy high school, quit college on third year because of loneliness and depression. Never got any job. I spent last eight years basically 24/7 with either my father or mother. I don't get out without my dad and you know it's enough. He didn't had great life either he worked as police officer he never got any time to relax and rest because he is basically babysitting me ever since he retired.

"Post: And instead of enjoying the break, I want to be here less. I had maybe one hour of reflection all week where I felt grateful for this job. Grateful to be making $30k out of college. But then I fell asleep and was back it by morning. How working full time @ 24 won't allow me to survive on my own.

"Post: I hate staying at University accommodation. I haven’t made any real friends and I constantly feel homesick. I’m not severely depressed, it’s more of prolonged mild depression so I think I have Dysthymia. Can’t be certain though because I haven’t spoken to a professional yet. Every morning I wake up dreading the thought of going into work, spending 6 hours walking around a shop floor, only to end up with another 7/8 hours left until I sleep again. There’s only so much I can do in the day and it doesn’t help that I procrastinate. I have exams soon and I haven’t even started revising. I hate myself for being so lazy and idiotic. I just want to be at home. Or somewhere where I am surrounded my family and people I like. People who are on the same wavelength as me, who share my interests and have stuff in common. I have numerous days were I am happy but then I just get back home and feel so depressed because it was a one-off. Sometimes I just have these thoughts where I think that death would get rid of everything. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would care if I died. Though I don’t want to carry out these thoughts, but these thoughts are often. I just don’t want to be alone anymore, and I don’t know what to do.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career.

Post: I never knew my father he left before i was born. My mother told me he started a charity for boys without father's after he left that and his first name is all i know about him. Four years ago my mom and stepfather made a move overseas from my home country. The transition has been difficult i feel alienated and haven't made any friends for four years other than brief online relationships. Unfortunately the move also took me out of school past the age of 13 i haven't had an education. My mom is to busy to maintain homeschool and my stepdad doesn't care for me as he does my mom. I was born in another country and he already has two children of his own I guess this is why he doesn't pay attention to me. It's hard being alone or feeling that way I've always wanted to meet someone my own age I dream of it. Some days i wake up and I'll sneak out of the house to the park and hope to meet someone. I haven't yet. My 18th birthday is happening this year and that's a big number to me but I'm afraid nothing is going to change its like I'm stuck in a purgatory while everyone else gets to go to school and have friends get a job. I'm in a village with a handful of houses in a country i wasnt born in. I have dreams and I even turned my room into a little acomplishement zone to achieve mini goals so that one day I'll be able to accomplish those dreams. Sometimes things just seem unfair i feel like I'm chipping away at a granite wall with a plastic spoon. My parents dont listen for years i begged them for an activity or something to give me growth and interaction with other kids it never happened. What's the purpose for all this happening why have i been put in a time of obscurity for this long? Sorry for the rant has anyone had a similar experience of being alone like this. I'm sure alot of people who grew up homeschooled experienced what im feeling.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship.

Post: I’m proud of my accomplishments but I always second guess everything. What if I did this differently? Why didn’t I do this better? It’s gotten to the point where I compare myself to my colleagues and friends and their successes and motivations. I want to be motivated into achieving more but thoughts of inadequacy has kept me in a state of stagnation. How do I convince myself to be ok with where I’m at in life and gain the motivation to move forward?

Because of this I feel isolated and alone in my feelings and unsure of my future. I love my friends and family but I’ve never seen them as the type of people to have serious conversations about my distress with and I don’t want their perception of me to change if I tell them.

"Post: Alone at New Year's Eve. I remembered that my friends were on their sides, partying with their friends, and I'm not even here. I drank a beer earlier to have some sort of fun... but I don't feel like drinking the second one I bought. And I felt empty... I took my pocket knife, washed it, and started cutting on my right arm. Strange thing is, I'm right-handed, but I've always cut with my left hand. Now I feel like I'm 16 again. And I feel like an idiot. But I needed to see I was still living.

"Post: Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that the individual's friend has been experiencing a depression spiral and has sought help from psychologists and psychiatrists, who have suggested medication as a form of treatment.

This indicates that the mental disorder in question may be related to medication or the individual's resistance to taking medication. The post also mentions the friend's panic attacks, inability to work or remember things consistently, and thoughts of self-harm, which further suggest that medication may be necessary to manage their symptoms and improve their mental well-being."

"Post: I just was hoping a few people could weigh in on their experiences with anti-depressants and tell me the good and bad experiences they've had. I'm not particularly fond of the idea of having to swallow a pill in order to feel happy but if I can do something to feel good everyday and not like this then I wonder if it's worth it? I went to the doctors a while back and they tried to offer me some but I never took them and I don't think he really got in my head that well, mainly because I didn't want to let some stranger in. But yeah please feel free to leave your opinions please  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none.

"Post: 02:00 AM. January 2. One year ago. At this moment, I committed suicide. I cut my wrists, arms, veins on joints both vertically and horizontally. Blood bath. Over 80 stitches. Exactly one year ago. Now, I'm looking at myself. Nothing has changed. I might be one of the mentally worst person here. Still.

"Post: So on boxing day, the people I live with (Dad, step mom, step sister and little brother) went to stay at my step moms dads as it's a bit of a tradition. So I went to my moms house. Hopefully getting drunk... again... So we invited the old man my mom looks after for dinner. We ate, he enjoyed it so did we all then after all that we took him home. Aftet that we went to the store and brought some echo falls, dissarrono ( can't spell for shit sorry ) and coke. I'm 16 so I gave my mom the money for it lol. So when we got home I decided to get pissed. Nearly drank the whole bottle of dissarrono in about an hour. Totally fucked. So my retarded self decided to have a breakdown and then tell my sister that I think about killing myself every day and night and that I hate my life so much. I was a mess. But she laughed while I was in tears. Funny right? I also pretend to slit my wrists with a fork which was the first thing I grabbed out of the cookery. Kinda wish I pulled out a knife. She didn't say a word about it in the morning nor did my mom who was upstairs trying to sleep. Few dayd past, family go to my step disters cousin's family party, so I go to my moms again, and decided to jam along to my music with my mom in the kitchen, it then got to the depressing music and it ended up my mom pretending to slit her wrists and said to me ""No wonder you've been feeling depressed listening to this shit"" I wish I said to her that it helps me or some crap like that. Fun right? Got another post coming up in a bit aswell about my most recent fuck up.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of self-harm thoughts, a breakdown, and feelings of hating life and wanting to die. The poster also mentions their sister's insensitive reaction to their emotional turmoil and their mother's inappropriate response by pretending to slit her wrists.

"Post: Hey everybody, I ran out of my Lexapro/Cipralex meds about a week ago, having an emergency appointment with the doc tomorrow. Since I ran out, I've been having these weird pulses in my head, lots of cranial pressure and ringing in the ears for a couple seconds, and then it subsides. Sometimes it coincides with movement (like getting up from a chair, but also like going up in an elevator). Does anyone have any experience going cold turkey from escitalopram? Is this a known symptom of sudden stoppage? Thanks.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",medication.

"Post: 2015 was the exact same as 2016. 2014 was the exact same as 2013. I feel like I'm in fucking limbo and I am invisible. I never get invited for things on new years. Also, nothing ever changes. Nothing in my life changes each year. I feel like I meet with the same people, do the same things, eat the same things, never get luck with romance, etc. It's all a waste of fucking time! Why waste time to celebrate the same year with the same shit as the last. I never get out of the same places, people, and situations. It's all the same. I hate it. The only thing I enjoy is getting drunk on the new years and that's it. I'm only 19 and I feel like nothing will change in my life. My life will probably be the same when I'm 30 years fucking old. Nothing exciting. Every girl rejects me that I like. Every guy rejects me that I like. No romance. Nothing. Well, good night. I hope you all had a great new years and I hope you all have a great year. I don't my own year cause I know it will be the same.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of being stuck and invisible, with no changes occurring in the poster's life.

"Post: Been dealing with depression and anxiety for the last few years. Tried to live life normally when I’m outside my room. Friends didn’t even know I had it cause I tried the hardest to not let it affect my everyday life, even though I go through lots of anxiety attacks throughout the day. Yesterday, I just needed one break from work, first time to ever do that and was told I needed to “toughen up”. Felt really bad about it. All these years I’ve been dealing with my anxiety and depression without letting it affect my work ever, and now that i just needed a day off, I get that message.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's struggle with depression and anxiety for the past few years. They also discuss their efforts to hide their mental health issues from friends and colleagues and their ability to manage their symptoms while at work.

This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders in this post is related to job-related stress and lack of support from their employer."
"Post: So I have clinical depression. It's not super bad with meds, but it's always there and makes me perceive my situation as worse. I basically live in the lap of luxury, with rich parents and an amazing acadmic school. However, I am also extremely lazy. I despise doing work and even though I'm pretty good at school (I'm a freshman in high school) I know I need to improve next year (first year at my school grades don't matter). This is because I absolutely must get into Harvard. All my siblings and both of my parents went there, and I would be a complete fuckup and embarassment if I didn't. Perhaps it's irrational but it would be crushing to me, I might kill myself. I have no friends at school, most people think I'm creepy (at the beginning I tried really hard to get a girlfriend and it backfired), overly pushy, annoying, etc. My siblings, who I'm very close with, are rarely home, and I'm sort of the family problem child (they're all virtually perfect.) My parents are usually good but they put me under a lot of pressure. My life should feel good but I fucking hate it and I don't know how to handle 3 and a half more years of this with no friends, little sleep due to homework, boredom and stress. Oh and I'm also somewhat addicted to videogames, they're all I do in my free time because I have no friends or physical talent (I also hate sports), and sometimes even cut into my homework time which is why I'm getting B+s instead of A's which I NEED to get. It's not as bad as a lot of the horror stories you find here. But I don't know how Im going to get through the next few years...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors related to the poster's jobs and career that are contributing to their mental disorders. They express pressure to attend Harvard and the fear of being seen as a failure or embarrassment if they don't get in, indicating a significant amount of stress related to their academic and career goals. They also mention being the ""family problem child"" and feeling like they don't measure up to their siblings who are seen as ""virtually perfect,"" suggesting a sense of inadequacy and pressure from their family. The poster also mentions a lack of friends at school and boredom, which could be contributing to their negative emotions and sense of isolation. Finally, their addiction to video games and the impact it has on their academic performance and lack of physical activity suggests that their jobs and career aspirations are also impacting their ability to manage their time and find a healthy work-life balance."
"Post: TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine. ... Example, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. Go to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like ""Oh no, what the fuck is that!?"" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. I soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. Again, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. You end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. People at work say, ""Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down"", or ""I think i know what youre sad about"". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. You just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. We always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome. (This isnt well written, im never as smart on paper as i think i am in my head, but id love to hear if anyone relates to this or has any thoughts).  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post discusses the disconnect between how the poster feels mentally and how their body physically presents. They describe feeling fine mentally, but their face and body manifest depression and sadness, making it impossible for them to convey their true emotions to the world. This sense of alienation and disconnect between their internal state and external appearance is likely causing mental disorders for the poster, as they are unable to authentically express themselves and feel understood by others."

"Post: But they think it's cause I got too fucked up and didn't know what I was talking about. I feel like a fucking idiot for doing it, I never thought the words would come out of my mouth in front of anyone. I don't know if them believing me or thinking I'm lying is worse. I figured if I ever told anyone they'd care, or you know, say fucking anything about it. But all's back to normal now, they didn't have any sort of revelation out of it. I just got too drunk, is all. I can't wait until they hear the news I've finally done it, and they just think ""Fuck. She wasn't just too drunk.""  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior."
Post: I always just want to say that there’s nothing they can do. It’s all on me. But maybe that’s the wrong thing to say...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,alienation.

"Post: Hi all, I am a 20 year old male in college and I have been going through an especially hard time lately, so I wanted to share my story with depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My hope is that my writing this out I can relieve some pain and maybe if anyone else is struggling with something similar they can feel comfort knowing they are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 years old, after I got a strep throat infection I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder such as ticks (biting my shirt, blinking my eyes excessively, craning my neck a certain way a lot). I worried about little things, such as if there was a seam on my sock or a tag on my shirt, I would feel so much discomfort that I could not wear it. When I worried about things, sometimes I felt pains in either side of my body, if I didn't feel the pain in the other side of my body it felt wrong and the decision I made in my head felt wrong. Anyway, my ticks got worse after taking a certain medication that I forget the name of, and then they got better after I got off it. I started having more rituals, like washing my hands and walking across mirrors multiple times to get it ""right"". This later turned into more obsessive thoughts, which are what I primarily suffer from now. I am not in therapy right now and I am not taking any medication. In high school, I feel like I was happier because I had a small group of friends and a best friend who was a girl that I loved. A year later, I did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that. This was really hard for me at the time, she was so funny and genuinely nice I thought, she was absolutely beautiful and I took her to prom which was a shitty night because she ignored me most of the night. I ignored that red flag, and many others, I was 18 and I had never been in a relationship before and I fell for her hard. After we stopped talking to each other, which was around December of 2016, I believe she texted me out of the blue in March of last year and we chatted a bit. That was all the contact we had until we saw each other at school when the semester started 4 months ago because she goes to the same college I do. It was good to see her, she told me she had a boyfriend that she broke up and he was an asshole, I had never met him. At the time I told myself that was okay she had moved on, I accepted that she was changing on and that I could move on too. I underestimated my feelings though because I ended up texting her and apologizing to her for whatever reason, and she apologized too. Things were well and good until I found out she had another boyfriend through a story she posted on Snapchat, and I freaked out. I blocked her phone number, Snapchat, Instagram and everything. I completely cut contact with her for 4 months. Until 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time recently as friends but she cut me off again and I don't know if I deserve it or not but it makes me feel bad of course. I have a part time job, but it's not enough hours and I am going to see if I can't get more or maybe find something to do on the side. It makes me feel worse to not work or go to school and be around other people, I do not have any friends now, and I have been crying over something every day in recent months because of my depression. My family does not think I have depression, my mom has the key on the gate because she had postpartum depression and according to her that was real depression but not mine. I am just ""stir crazy"" from not working, and she is pushing me to get another job. When she says that to me it makes me feel invalid and worthless, which I feel like anyway pretty much anyway, I love her but I hate it when she makes me feel this way about myself. My dad does not think too much about my mental health, and neither does my mom's boyfriend. Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with you all. It made me feel better to type it out as I have been having an extremely hard week. I was on a high because my best friend and I started talking again and spending time together 2 weeks ago, now she is ign  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's struggles with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their history of experiencing symptoms since a young age. They also mention the impact of medication on their symptoms, with their ticks getting worse and then improving after stopping the medication. The post then delves into their experiences with relationships, particularly their intense feelings for a girl who they believed was their best friend. They describe the pain of the relationship not being reciprocated and the subsequent impact on their mental health. The post also mentions the poster's current lack of friends and the negative impact of not working or being around other people. They express feelings of worthlessness and invalidation from their family, which further contributes to their depression. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's relationship experiences and perceived lack of support from their family."
"Post: Today do some self care. A moment to yourself. You are worth it. Remember, new year, new you. Lets make this a year we kick depressions ass.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions ""kicking depressions ass"" and emphasizes the importance of self-care. While it doesn't explicitly mention medication, the reference to depression suggests that the poster may be using medication as a method of managing their mental health. The mention of a ""new year, new you"" also implies a desire for a fresh start or a change in their mental health outlook, which could also involve medication as part of their treatment plan."
"Post: He has depression. He told me that he lost someone important to him and he's been feeling emotionless since. This person apparently passed away without warning and it was within the last month. We were somewhat dating and I noticed he pulled away, which I thought was him ghosting, but he said he was ready for a relationship with me before this happened. I'm not sure what to do now... or what to say to his messages explaining this. Any advice? Should I offer to see him in person or do you think he doesn't want anything to do with me right now? As an fyi, I've never been to his house and don't know where he lives specifically so that's not an option.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that the person has depression and that it was triggered by the loss of someone important to them. They also mention feeling emotionless since the loss. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder is related to their grief and loss, rather than bias or abuse, jobs and career, relationship issues, alienation, or a lack of medication."
Post: How much trouble would I be in if I pointed a squirt gun that looked like a real gun at a cop? Assuming that I was shot at but still survived would I get in trouble by the law if they knew that my intentions were suicide and that I had no real weapon?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests a sense of alienation and desperation. The poster is contemplating a dangerous and potentially fatal act of pointing a realistic-looking squirt gun at a cop, with the intention of being shot. They mention feeling suicidal and wanting to know if they would get in trouble with the law, indicating a deep sense of disconnection from society and a lack of hope for their future. This sense of alienation and despair is likely contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess. I wish I would just kill myself, instead.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling constantly suicidal, which suggests a long-standing and persistent mental health issue. The poster also mentions feeling guilty for their suicidal thoughts despite having a caring family and being well-off, indicating a sense of confusion and frustration about their feelings. They specifically mention their birthday and how they have to work for their parents' business every year, feeling trapped and resentful towards their parents. This connection between their job and their feelings of despair and desire to die indicates that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their jobs and career."
"Post: I know I've probably said this countless times before, but fuck, when I think about the way that I act and speak I just get filled with this hatred and hopelessness. I can't stand myself, I don't know why I'm like this but I'm a god awful person to be around. I can't keep up a conversation to save my life, it seems like no matter what I'm just repulsive in every way. Nobody wants to talk to me for more than a few minutes, the amount of times I've been left ""on read"" as the cool kids say, is too many to count. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but at the same time I'm painfully aware of how awkward, unfunny, negative and all around incomprehensible I am. I can barely string together a coherent sentence. It's like every time I try to talk to someone my mind just blanks and I don't know how to reply, no matter how much time I spend forming my response it's always hard to read trash. I can't do anything right, I'm mean, sarcastic, unfunny, awkward and just plain stupid with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst time. I'm just so hopeless, I'm so tired of being me and living with this irredeemable trash pile for a brain. It feels like there's nothing I can do to change or improve, no matter what I'll always be this rude sack of shit that's hated almost universally by everyone around them. I wish I had the balls to end it all and save the world from having to deal with me, I'm so damn selfish for keeping myself alive like this.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels isolated and disconnected from others. They express a strong self-hatred and a belief that they are repulsive and disliked by everyone. They describe their inability to maintain conversations, feeling awkward, unfunny, and negative. They also mention being left ""on read"" and feeling like they can never do anything right. This deep sense of alienation and self-disdain is a likely cause of their mental disorders."
"Post: I’m 15 years old, and I turn 16 in 9 days. I feel lonely all the time and only have a few friends. It gets pretty bad sometimes and I start to think about killing myself. When I feel this way, i usually can’t sleep and am an emotional train wreck. Is this normal or am I crazy or what?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling lonely and having thoughts of suicide. It also mentions difficulty sleeping and being emotionally unstable. These symptoms indicate a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, which may be contributing to the poster's mental health struggles."
"Post: I’ve sat in a dark room for 5 hours staring at a wall, doing nothing. Yet I still felt as bored as if I were to just watch Netflix or play games. I feel bored and scared. Scared that I lost my mind and will never be normal again.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling bored and scared, but does not suggest any specific relationship issues, bias or abuse, medication side effects, or a sense of alienation. However, the post does mention sitting in a dark room for 5 hours and feeling bored, which could suggest a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in their current situation. This could be related to their job or career, as they may feel unfulfilled or stagnant in their professional life. Therefore, the assigned label is jobs and career."
"Post: I thought I was getting over it. But now after eight years my depression has reached a new stage. I've managed to self-medicate with video games and youtube for years, but over the past couple weeks it stopped working. Now nothing is interesting anymore. It's driving me absolutely bonkers. I'm so stir crazy. I'm SO BORED. But I don't want to to do anything. Nothing feels worth my time. Everything makes me feel guilty that I'm not doing something else. I wish I knew hot how to emphasize how bad this is. I can FEEL it inside me, like a thirst. Like I'm craving some physical thing and if it was in front of me I'd pounce and devour it like a tiger. I've always felt uncomfortable in my skin, now it's like all of me. I need to rip myself apart to tear the corruption out. I'm going mad, just mad. Like I desperately need a sedative or something before I spiral out of control. I've never thought more seriously about hospitalizing myself. If I wasn't afraid of the treatment I'd get I'd do it now. Someone please give me some advice.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a sense of extreme boredom and restlessness, as well as guilt and a lack of interest in anything. The poster also describes feeling uncomfortable in their own skin and a desperate need for something to alleviate their distress. These feelings of alienation and disconnection from oneself are likely contributing to the mental disorders described in the post. The mention of feeling the need to rip oneself apart and the consideration of hospitalization further emphasize the severity of the alienation and the need for support and advice."

Feel free to do the same and post them in the comments, guys.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post mentions making a list of things the poster wants to do before they kill themselves, which suggests a serious mental health concern. However, the post does not provide any specific information about the cause of their mental state.

"Post: So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this. I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better. I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd. Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write. I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet. She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself. So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other. She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away. It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something. I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them. The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not. Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of depression, rejection, and bullying, which suggests a potential bias or abuse in the poster's past. They also mention struggling with mental illness, specifically mentioning depression and Avoidant Personality Disorder (avpd). The post discusses their relationship with a girl who has experienced abuse in the past, which further highlights the presence of abuse or bias in their lives. Additionally, the poster mentions having dark thoughts and idealizing suicide, which can be indicative of the negative impact of bias or abuse on their mental well-being."

Reasoning: The post mentions feeling down due to trials and problems at both home and school. This suggests that the poster's mental disorder is likely caused by relationship issues within both their personal and academic life.
"Post: Just a disclaimer, this is a throwaway account just simply because I don't feel confident enough to use my actual account, I will be logged in for quite a while on my phone just in case anyone replies, which even if it doesn't I don't mind just needed to write this for myself... So a little about myself and why I am posting here now. I have been lurking in this subreddit on and off since I found out it existed, about 6 months back. I've been dealing with a lot of dark thoughts and surprisingly don't even want to get better. I have no idea where all of these dark thoughts are coming from since I had a good childhood and was always a nice guy and good friends that I could count on. However, since I started university (2 years ago, in my final year now), I've distanced myself from my friends and to some extent my family. There was no apparent reason for it. This distancing however lead to me realising my own feelings more and more and to some extent ""find my inner self"". All my life I've dealt with my issues by helping others resolve their and I've always gotten by one way or another, with me abandoning most of my friends this has led to me not being able to help others. As a result of that I've had to deal with my own problems on my own and had to face them. Let's just say that did not go well. I am 6 months away from graduating and have zero idea of what I want to do with my life. I have my parents counting on me to figure this out and frankly that pressure keeps getting me into panic attacks every time I think about it and I start breathing faster, my heart beat goes up and I just want to start shouting. I know that this message is quite long but I've seen longer one's on here so I'm gonna stop while I still fall within the average and don't scare anyone off. I hope everyone is getting through their day alright.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a sense of isolation and distancing from friends and family since starting university. This distancing has led to the poster realizing their own feelings more and facing their own problems without the ability to help others, which has been their coping mechanism in the past. They also mention feeling pressure from their parents to figure out their future after graduation, which is causing panic attacks. These factors suggest that relationship issues, specifically a lack of connection and support from others, are contributing to the mental disorders in this post."
"Post: Im 17 and today I realised I fucked up. Im the kind of guy who have the looks but have no game or social skills with strangers, my sex life is once a month when I go to the club because I dont need to talk to pickup girls there. I want a gf but I cant build real connections with anyone and I have many insecurities, the last one that I had was 5 years ago. I have no friends in my class, my days are lonely as fuck, I dont want to wake up to go to school. Due to my social problems my grades dropped, so my parents are pissed of with me. I wonder what it takes to have good grades and a good social life. Highschool life is not that good...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster feels isolated and disconnected from others, specifically mentioning a lack of social skills and difficulty building connections with people. They also mention feeling lonely and not wanting to wake up and go to school, suggesting a sense of alienation from their peers. The post also mentions their grades dropping and their parents being upset with them, further emphasizing the negative impact of their alienation on their mental well-being."
"Post: I want to change, but when I get depressed I want to escape so bad I start losing control of myself and my friends start to get annoyed because I ask for there help too frequently. I'll start blowing up there phone saying I need help and can't be here anymore and etc. Even the ones who do want to help me get tired of me. I can't go to the hospital because that's a huge hospital bill, it's really embarrassing, they'll tie me down and force medication down my throat. How do I get through this?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing depression and feeling a loss of control during these episodes. The poster also mentions reaching out to friends for help and feeling like a burden to them. They express a fear of going to the hospital for treatment due to financial concerns, embarrassment, and the potential for being forced to take medication. This suggests that medication may be a necessary and potentially helpful form of treatment for the poster's mental disorders."
"Post: I have Asperger's Syndrome...it makes understanding social cues, empathizing with others (IE understanding why you made someone upset), and social interaction in general very difficult. When compounded with existing depression, it makes me feel profoundly isolated sometimes. Things have been looking up somewhat recently - I graduated college and am currently looking for a full-time job - but the fact that I will always struggle with this disorder and find it difficult to interact with others makes me profoundly sad. A relationship seems impossible, as does sex. I don't mind living by myself and have tried to come to peace with it, but being a round peg in a world of square holes does get to you sometimes. Things can get better for me, but nobody else will know about it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions having Asperger's Syndrome, which is a mental disorder that impacts social interaction and understanding. The poster also mentions experiencing depression and feelings of profound isolation. They discuss how these difficulties make it challenging to interact with others, have relationships, and experience sexual intimacy. While the post does not explicitly mention medication, it talks about the struggles and sadness associated with the disorder and implies the need for some form of treatment or support to manage these challenges. Medication is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, which often go hand in hand with Asperger's Syndrome. Therefore, the assigned label for this post is Medication."

Reasoning: The post does not provide any information about the causes of the poster's perceived misery or its impact on others.

"Post: I grew up in a toxic environment, now that I'm older, all the trauma is coming at me like a freight train and I'm just left to deal with it. Who else's family is the main cause of their depression?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",relationship. Reasoning: The post states that the poster grew up in a toxic environment and is now experiencing trauma as a result. They also mention that their family is the main cause of their depression. This suggests that the poster's mental disorders are caused by their past relationship with their family and the resulting trauma.
"Post: Hi, I'm 17, male, and I've been having depressed thoughts for about a year now (not sure if that qualifies as having depression). I have friends, but I'm constantly scared that they don't actually like me and when they do i assume they're lying (i have been lied to about that in the past and that makes it hard to trust them). Im not close with any of them after they all turned on me when someone spread rumors about me once (long story, we sorted it out but i don't feel right about them after they hated me so quickly without question). I'm constantly terrified of being too obsessive around the people i like and driving them away, and that I'm way too desperate for a friendship or relationship i can feel good about. I get extremely self loathing around them and this causes those who i am close with to get annoyed at me i think. Im scared of opening up to anyone about how bad my self hatred has gotten because theyll just think it's juvenile (not sure about that myself tbh) or whether it's just me fishing for sympathy. I try to be nice to people but i think i take it to an extreme and be too apologetic of anything i think may annoy someone slightly. I have no idea what to do with myself so i read or play games to turn my brain off so i don't have to think about anything. I wish i could talk to someone about it all since it makes me feel better but i feel like they'll just be annoyed at me for wasting their time. I constantly have this feeling in my chest of worthlessness that i feel physically, it keeps me awake at night and wears me down. I never used to consider suicide until a few months back, but now these thoughts are getting more and more frequent until I'm thinking them every day. I just want to make this feeling go away and I'll do anything to make it happen. I'm sorry for posting this here but i don't know what to do, i feel so purposeless and i want it to end. I've never spoken about these feelings with anyone. I don't know if there's a specific subreddit for venting so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and fear of rejection in their relationships with friends and potential romantic partners. They mention past experiences of being lied to and their friends turning on them, which has made it difficult for them to trust others. The post also mentions a fear of being too obsessive or desperate in their relationships, and feeling self-loathing and constantly apologizing for fear of annoying others. These experiences and emotions all point to relationship-related issues as the cause of their mental disorders."
"Post: I believe that when I find my place in this world that I will be complete and normal. Right now and since years I feel lost and don't know what I want, don't know what I have to do, don't know if the answer is yes or no. I tried. I tried finding a solution. I tried finding purpose. I tried finding something that makes me a whole. I know it's not *something* I am looking for, it's rather *myself*. I am the shell of myself and I need my inner core back but it's gone. And I'm done looking for it. I waited long enough. I endured so much. I endured so many bad things. In the end.. a shell without it's core is going to fall together sooner or later. It's time.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling lost and not knowing what they want or what they have to do. They express a sense of longing for finding their place in the world and becoming complete and normal. They also mention feeling like a shell without their inner core and feeling like they have endured many bad things. These feelings of disconnection, lack of purpose, and a longing for a sense of self suggest a sense of alienation from oneself and a need for self-discovery and self-acceptance."
Post: How do I make it end? It hurts.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post does not provide much context, but the phrase ""How do I make it end? It hurts"" suggests that the poster is feeling intense emotional pain and is seeking a way to make it stop.

Post: My boyfriend and his family and some friends sat around the dinner table on New Years Eve and we talked about our New Years resolutions. When it came around to me I declined saying that what I had to say was a bit depressing. I was encouraged to talk and choking on tears I simply said that I wanted to see New Years Eve 2017. None of us thought I'd even be here to see this one. Everyone went quiet and looked away. One of the friends put his hand on my shoulder and encouraged me saying he was proud. I was too emotional to say thank you but it meant so much to me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post discusses a personal experience of the poster feeling emotional and grateful for the support received after expressing their desire to see New Year's Eve 2017.

"Post: This is the first time I'm making the conscious effort to enjoy myself rather than wallow in my depression and self pity because nobody invited me to a NYE party. I've never before taken steps towards self care so that in itself is an accomplishment and I'm proud of it. Will I be back to my self destructive and self pitying ways soon? Who knows, but for just one day I'm going to allow myself to take care of me and if you've been looking for any encouragement or a sign to do the same then hopefully this is it. I've decided nobody gives a shit that you're laying in bed crying and the only person who can make me happy is myself if I just allow myself to enjoy things. Instead of purposely listening to that sad music when I'm already sad, I'm going to listen to my dumb 70's upbeat playlist. Today is no different than any other day except for the fact that society deems it the start of a new year when in reality time is just a construct. The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct. The sun will still set and rise like it does everyday. If you give in to looking at social media you will see people getting drunk and what appears to be having fun. Realize that yes, some of these people are genuinely out having a good time, but a majority of it is making things appear better than they really are. They're not posting pictures of people sitting on a chair scrolling through their phones (which is what happens for 90% of the time at the majority of parties), they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun and shit is wild and right after the camera shutter goes off they're back to scrolling on their phones. Some of them are probably feeling fed up and wishing it was over. Some of them probably feel just as alone as they do when there's nobody around (and that's truly a worse feeling). I know this was true back when I used to get invited to parties. You, on the other hand, are at home surrounded by things you can enjoy. Movies, TV, video games, books, hobbies like drawing, you name it. Would you really be happier at that party? Anyway, I'm going to wrap this post up because, like I said, I have a day of fun shit to do by myself. If you're not ready to take the step towards self care, I get it. I've been depressed for a hell of a long time and never taken this step. But today I woke up and decided to do it. It'll happen for you eventually if it's not happening now. Happy NYE guys. My plan as well as tips for tonight: - Starting off eating a nice pot brownie that I've been saving (Also for the first time, I'm getting high because it's enjoyable, not as an escape) - Watch a movie (Never seen The Wolf of Wall Street and I think I'm going to try it out tonight) - Watch TV shows (I've been watching The Office lately) - Play a video game (I've been into Battlefield 1 and Civ 6 lately) - Depending on how high I get, watch Planet Earth (On a more serious note, shit puts things into perspective and reminds you how fucking cool the planet where we live is. People might suck sometimes, but nature is beautiful as fuck. The colors and scenery are amazing but I'll probably be high as shit crying when I see the predator killed the prey only to bring the food back to its own babies) - Fireworks get to me pretty badly, so if they get loud I'm going to put headphones in - Limit social media use (I know I won't be able to stop myself from checking, so I'll just remind myself of what I typed earlier when I do) - Eat good food (Try making something new or order out your favorite food) - Give my dog a hug and a treat at midnight - Get a good rest and wake up tomorrow like I do everyday I advise you to make a list like I did and if at any point you feel yourself drifting into self pity or whatever else, try to read it and do something on it to get you back on track to a good night :)  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's conscious effort to enjoy themselves and engage in self-care, specifically mentioning that they are making a change from wallowing in depression and self-pity. They also discuss the idea that society deems New Year's Eve as a time to be around others and have fun, but they challenge this construct and emphasize the importance of enjoying one's own company. The post emphasizes the enjoyment of solitary activities such as watching movies, TV shows, playing video games, and engaging in hobbies. This suggests that the poster feels isolated and disconnected from others, finding solace and fulfillment in their own company. This sense of alienation may be contributing to their mental disorders, as they struggle to find a sense of belonging and connection with others."

"Post: Premise, I have nocturnal enuresis. I'm 17 years old and this condition begins to be the most difficult thing in my life to deal with. Tonight, my parents let me stay at my boyfriend's house as a New Year's gift, so I slept here. I've been finding my bed dry in the morning for a few days, so not wanting to put on a diaper in his house I simply slept in his sleeping bag on the sofa. I fucked up. Though I only slept 2 hours and a half, I managed to wet his sleeping bag, his sofa, and both my pants and my dress. I don't know what to do now, I don't have clean clothes with me, and I know he'll be super mad at me when he wakes up. I hate myself.

Reasoning: The post explicitly mentions a fear of the poster's state of mind and the need for medication, indicating that their mental disorder is not caused by bias or abuse, job-related stress, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others."
"Post: Hello, I'm a 17 yo female high school senior. So I have many problems, and I'm not going to point each of them out for the sake of keeping this post as short as possible. I suffer from depression and loneliness and it's getting worse day by day. Ever since I was in Kindergarten, I was always the odd one out. Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here. Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally. I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely. All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship. Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.) And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before. Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression. I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries. I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide. My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them. Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns. I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more. Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart. And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it. Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am. I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem. So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about? With kindest regards,  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's experiences of being bullied, looked down upon, and made fun of by classmates and teachers. They also mention feeling alone and isolated, with few real-life interactions and friendships. They express a deep sense of self-hatred and struggles with depression, including multiple suicide attempts. The post also mentions a strict father and a family that does not understand the poster's problems. These experiences of bullying, feeling unwelcome, and lack of support from family contribute to the mental disorders mentioned, suggesting that bias or abuse is the likely cause of their mental disorders."
"Post: Recently I received some bad news at home — another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly. I don’t want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my “luck” is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me. My life is a story of waste: Brilliant, but not using that brain power at work; successful, but not enough to reach my goals. Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way. It drives me nuts, and feeds into the “black and white thinking” that plagues me. So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether. Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice. He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else. I’m thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills. But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them. I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year. I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds. I just needed to vent. I feel like I have no one and nothing. I constantly mutter things under my breath (often without realizing it) such as “I hate my life.” It’s just hard to see how the story of my life turns out well.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's decision to stop taking medication due to feeling that it is futile to continue taking it. They also mention a history of negative events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and the presence of ""black and white thinking."" This suggests that the mental disorders experienced by the poster are linked to their negative thoughts and experiences, as well as their decision to discontinue medication."
"Post: I really just want any glimmer of hope to cling to that my life won't end empty and alone as it has been so far in my years. There's really no chance of my romantic situation ever changing though... So I'm back to sitting alone with no hope, just me and my shitty brain I don't even want. I don't know why my depression is so bad today, not sure if it's the new year and the prospect of going around again with the same old bullshit of being rejected or the amount of happy couples I saw today. That always gets me... Seeing people happy, just wishing you could feel things like love, affection, closeness with someone...but knowing that's the one part of life you are permanently gated from. All I want to do is die but I can't so I guess lifetime of misery it is..  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling empty and alone, with no hope for a change in their romantic situation. They express a desire for love, affection, and closeness with someone, but feel permanently gated from experiencing these things.

Post: I finished my studies in June 2017. It's when my depression got worst where I am not motivated to do anything at all and just stay at home doing nothing when I'm supposed to be looking for a job/goals in life.

"Post: I don't know when it hit me, I just feel down all the time. I can't remember a moment I haven't been anxious or worried. It's starting to engulf me slowly, and I'm afraid I can't escape it. I'm not diagnosed, nor have I self diagnosed because I am too scared and ashamed to think maybe I do have a problem. I'm seen as the happy one, making people laugh and helping everyone out. I don't want to tell my parents, my friends, because I'm scared they'll think I'm doing this for attention, or because I'm weak. I can't bring myself to tell them I feel useless, that my life has no direction and I'm constantly worried, anxious and tired. I always think about my life as a set of goals, that once done i'll feel a bit happier, or that life will just get better; - Afford to buy a new car. Done, I still feel bad. - Grow your biceps 2"". Done. I still feel bad. - Increase your benchpress. Done. I still feel bad. .. and so on. I'm not asking for help, I just needed to say it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling down and anxious all the time, as well as a fear of being judged or seen as weak if they were to confide in others. They also express a sense of feeling useless and directionless, and mention setting goals as a way to potentially improve their happiness but finding that it doesn't work.

"Post: Hi, I've had pretty bad depression and anxiety issues since i was in middle school and have pretty much hated myself ever since i can remember. I'm also an introvert and generally cant stand to be around people other than a select few. I Went to a therapist early in highschool who said i had some form of depression, but my parents never really followed through getting any medication for me (i dont think they really believe depression is a problem). I've been in a pretty huge slump since I've been out of high school (almost 4 years) compounded by the fact that just recently my best friend decided he would check out early. I want to get some professional help before things get any worse. I have a job and insurance but not a lot of money. I am not suicidal (i guess i was up until recently and i found out how bad being on the other end feels), but now that this is no longer an option i feel like i am just trapped in a 100 foot hole with no way out. Really i am posting because i have questions i am hoping to have answered by anyone with experience on the subject. 1. Is a general practice doctor usually someone who can prescribe anti depressants? Im not sure my insurance would cover any sort of mental health doctor.(i generally hate doctors and pharmaceuticals and avoid both at all costs, hopefully until now as i cant really see any other resolution) 2. How do i know if they(drugs) would even help? Any particular ""feelings"" they prevent? 3. Do they help with anxiety or would that be something else? 4. Do they affect you physically? (Weight gain/loss, energy, ect.) 5. Generally speaking are any of the pharmaceuticals i might be prescribed expensive? Thanks for any help/advice anyon can give in advance.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's long-term struggles with depression and anxiety, as well as feelings of self-hatred and social aversion.

The recent loss of their best friend also adds to their current emotional state. The poster expresses a desire to seek professional help and asks specific questions about medication, suggesting that they are considering medication as a possible solution for their mental health issues. This indicates that the cause of the mental disorders in this post may be related to the poster's relationship with their parents and their lack of access to appropriate support and treatment for their depression and anxiety."
"Post: I've noticed that I tend to smile when the topic of suicide or self-harm comes up, or things related to those. I was in the process of a psych admission when the SW talking to me pointed out that I was smiling while we were discussing a suicide note I left in my wallet. I was just watching a YouTube video of a gamer, and the game hinted at a relative of the main character cutting herself and I smiled. Why in the hell do I do this? It's not funny, I don't find it humorous. I know it's not me being uncomfortable, because I just clam up when I am.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none.

"Post: EDIT: today was a better day. Thank you for allowing me to lean on you I just can't do it anymore. I tried to get better. The meds, the therapy, the physical activity. It didn't work.

"Post: I am at a hotel in a foreign country. There is a party going on in the lobby that all my friends are at. I left to lie in bed (where I currently am). They are coming to get me soon even though I really don’t want to go back down there. This year has been the toughest in my life and I just found out next year I likely won’t be accepted to med school. Idk how to move on. I know I’m being a buzzkill tonight but I seriously just can’t bring myself to get back down there. To everyone feeling shitty this New Year’s Eve, you are not alone.

"Post: Well, this person is useless, society doesn't need them, no one does. But that makes these people lonely, and sad, trying to figure out what they did wrong alone, while constantly trying the fact that anything is wrong at all. This is how I've felt for the past two years. I don't think that everyone has the same view that I just described, but for me, that is as I see it. I am alone, sad and depressed, just hoping that someone would see me, and say more than just a rushed hello as they walk by, back into the mob of the others who followed suit. But I guess that's too much to ask, why would anyone see me as someone to talk to, what could I possibly, say to make someone feel as if i haven't wasted their time? I don't know how many other people feel the same, but I don't like to burden other with my problem, and that's why I've kept quiet and I know that by posting here I'm completely contradicting what I just said, but, I need help, and going to a forum of people that want to give their help willingly doesn't make me feel like as much of a burden, I hope whoever is reading this shares similar views. To those of you who are left, thank you, I hope your day is going far better than mine. I'll try to kept this last part quick. I never thought my first post on reddit would be me opening up out my depression, but here I am. I need help, but I don't want to waste the time of people that could use it in better ways than talking to me. So to end this off, I want to know if anyone here has gone through something like this before, and what they did to win. Please help, I don't want to be alone anymore.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling lonely, sad, and depressed, as well as a desire for someone to see and talk to them.

Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's feelings of isolation and longing for meaningful relationships."
Post: I’m having a quarter life crisis again. I hate my introverted and shy personality. And my depression and anxiety don’t help.

"Post: I just left a happy but low paid job which I excelled at for one with better money and better prospects. But I absolutely hate it. I hate the thought of being there. I hate the thought of not being able to do the job. I hate how much more of my time it takes up despite only being contracted for two more hours than I was at my previous job. I understand that there comes nerves with a new start but I'm starting to wonder if it's all worth the effort if I was so much happier in my previous job, not just doing the work but it didn't invade my life with thoughts when I wasn't there. I have suffered from depression before, though not connected to work, and I can feel that the longer I am at my new job the less I'm enjoying my life. I've been absolutely miserable and unwanting to do anything in the past week. I don't know what to do. Any kind words would be greatly appreciated.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career.

"Post: Hey guys, I'm a 22 year old male from Australia. I'm very new to reddit and I thought that this is one of the most important message boards. I've had depression since I was approximately 15 after I lost a friend to suicide. My psychologist also believes I have borderline personality disorder. The whole point of this post is to say thank you for existing, you are not alone.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication.

This suggests that medication is likely a key factor in managing their mental disorders, as they are working with a psychologist and acknowledging the importance of support and community."
"Post: I don't know where to start or how long I want to type. It just comes and goes. So if I stop, I stop. I don't honestly expect anything to come from this. Sorry, I know this sub helps people, I just feel it's way too late now plus i've never had much help in the past. I understand that I am damaged and unable to maintain friendships or show kindness. But I knew him for two years. He had just gotten out of one abusive relationship and into another. I was there both times. I assure you I didn't do to try to get with him. I didn't think i was capapble of love. But he liked me. He liked me for what I was. He didn't see this thin, blonde girl with scars. He saw something different. But, he got back with his second ex who then abused him some more. She would cut if he wouldn't talk to her, laugh at his misfortunes. I was the one he went crying to every damn time. I was there when nobody else was. They broke up, big suprise and he asked me out. I said yes and entered two happiest months of my life. Followed by the 4 most miserable months until he finally showed me mercy and dumped me. He would constantly mock how skinny and pale I am. How my scars are easily noticeable, gee I never noticed. Laughed at my stories of abuse. But I loved him. I was stupid and I deserved to hurt. He would cut himself and encourage me to. I'm actually 7 months clean as of today but it's so hard not to go back. Now he's back with his ex again. And I hope he suffers. Bad. I'm tired of being used. I'm tired of being a freak. Why was I born this way? Why am I hated so? Fine. I give up. I wanted to go into more detail but i've wasted enough time and I don't wanna type no more. Sorry......

"Post: This summer I was very depressed after a break up and existential crisis. I ended up isolating myself in my room by not leaving often and my friend that stayed for the summer happens to be the one that loves belittling me, so they loved to see this. For some reason she is always so competitive and went out of her way to show that she had other friends and made fun of me for being in my room all the time. She was also the friend I was rooming with for the summer. I ended up failing my classes and taking the fall semester off because my depression became so bad. During the fall when I was at home I was fine, but now that im back at school all of the feelings came rushing back. I'm back at school by myself while my old friend group are probably getting together having fun somewhere. They didnt even contact me over the fall so i doubt that they care. I don't want to succumb to my depression again. I want to fit in somewhere this semester and do well. Any advice for this would be greatly appreciated.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a break-up, an existential crisis, and isolation in response to these events. It also describes the poster's friend belittling and being competitive towards them, causing further distress. The post reveals a sense of loneliness and a desire to fit in and do well in the upcoming semester.

"Post: I just wanted to get this off my chest. I have a feeling these past months thinking my dad will die soon. I feel it’s going to come and I won’t be able to make him happy. I can’t make him happy. I feel he’s been depressed for so long. I don’t know how to make him happy. I have tried everyday to think about positive things and how I would make him happier, but I can’t. My mindset is not right because he makes the family (my mom and I) unhappy everyday. He is always grumpy and I don’t know how to cheer him up. He doesn’t want to do anything. I don’t feel like trying anymore. I know he’s dying soon. I am so sad because of it. I am so sad I don’t get to spend enough time with him to make him happy. I’m sad because I disappointed him for not working and wanting to study. He wanted me to work instead of study. But that logic is flawed. Because I need to finish school so I can get a better job. For him. But he’s dying. And that makes me so unmotivated to do anything. Sometimes I feel like dying first. I want to give up life. Life is too hard.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's feelings of sadness and the belief that their father will die soon. They express a strong desire to make their father happy but feel unable to do so. They also mention their father's depression and how it affects the family's happiness. Additionally, the poster mentions feeling unmotivated and considering giving up on life. All of these factors suggest that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's relationship with their father."
"Post: Kinda a long post. And I'm sorry. I've spent majority of my life following in other people's footsteps or following a path someone else created for me. I've never really been given the chance to create my own footsteps.. until now. For the last year and a half I've been with a guy let's call Christian. He was great. Honestly. We never fought. We never really got mad. We always talked things through. We always made sure that we understood each other. And he understood me. He knew me so well. He knew when I was having an anxiety attack and he knew what to say to coax me out of it. He knew how to handle my depression. And honestly I could say that for the first time in my life I was happy. REALLY HAPPY. It honestly seemed too good to be true. And i guess looking back it was. In Sept he left to school. It's an odd school where he's on a boat and only has service at ports. So I could only really talk to him every couple of weeks and only if he found wifi. Well most of his ports are small towns in countries that it's harder to find wifi. You can imagine how hard this would be. But we were managing. We were trying. And in november I went to Spain to go visit him and everything seemed normal. But About a month ago he out of the blue dumped me. It was over text. He had called me earlier that day telling me he missed me and that he loved me. Then a couple hours later I got a text that turned my whole world upside down. I feel like a total wreck. It was so unexpected that I still have a hard time believing it. He left for sea shortly after and I've spent the better part of this month trying to survive. And while everyone around me has been supper supportive, I've never felt more alone. All I want is Christian. And I want him to make the hurt go away like he always does. But now it's my turn to make myself happy. And i don't know how. He comes home for semester break in 4 days and I'm not handling it very well. I don't want him to come back because just the thought of him in the same town makes me spiral out of control. This is the first time that I'll be able to focus on me without ever thinking of someone else when I make decisions. While I should be happy because it's a new chapter... I'm starting school.. moved into my first home... I've never felt more alone and empty. And the only thing that's been getting me through my day and keeping me asleep at night is my constant supply of weed. I literally have to stay high all the time in order to make it through the day. I have a therapist. I have a family. But I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared to open up because once I do I'm afraid I'll never stop crying. The worst part is he asked to see me when he's home so we can give our stuff back to each other. And talk about moving on. But I've let myself go so badly that im embarassrd to see him. I've gained over 20 pounds since I saw him in november. I don't want him to know I'm suffering. Or to know I'm dying on the onside. But he will know as soon as he sees me. I'm an emotional eater. I'm scared. I'm lost. And I don't know how to move on. I just need someone to tell me that im going to be okay. Tldr; my boyfriend dumped my ass leaving me feeling alone and unsure of how to find myself and heal. Edit: format  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's recent breakup and the emotional turmoil it has caused. They describe feeling alone, empty, and scared, and express their difficulty in moving on and finding themselves. The poster also mentions turning to substance use (weed) as a coping mechanism. These emotions and behaviors suggest that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is connected to the end of the relationship and the resulting feelings of loneliness and distress."
"Post: Depression it’s a bitch. Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don’t deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you’ve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn’t good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post describes feelings of worthlessness, self-doubt, and a constant voice in their head telling them negative things about themselves. The poster also mentions self-harm as a coping mechanism and the belief that they cause pain to others and are worthless. These thoughts and behaviors suggest a deep sense of alienation, disconnection, and self-isolation from others. The poster feels trapped in their own thoughts and believes that they do not deserve happiness or to be alive. This sense of profound alienation is likely causing their mental disorders."
"Post: I can't shake the feeling that the next year is going to be as bad as the last. I feel like I'm meant to be someone better in the new year. Like I had a whole year to improve my life, but here I am still depressed. Hope everyone has a good 2018.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling like the previous year was bad and a sense of hopelessness about the future.

"Post: Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me. Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere. I feel as if I'm critically handicapped towards achieving happiness. It kills me from the inside. Everyday I strive to make myself happy from little things. But they are temporary.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions several job-related stressors, including the financial damage caused to the company and the subsequent anger from the boss. The poster also discusses their anxiety and awkwardness in communicating with their boss, which they attribute to childhood experiences of being treated poorly. They mention that their happiness is tied to their boss's happiness, indicating a strong desire to please their superior. The post ends with the poster expressing feelings of depression and contemplating suicide due to their perceived inability to succeed and provide for their family. Therefore, it is clear that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to job-related stress and their feelings of inadequacy and failure in their career."
"Post: So my boyfriend has pretty severe depression. I'm the only person he talks to about it, and it's good that he can at least talk to someone, but I think he should tell his parents so he could try to get professional help. He refuses to talk to anyone but me about it and believes that a therapist can't help him, no matter how hard I've tried to convince him. He also believes taking medicine wouldn't help, even though I have tried to convince him. He is suicidal at least once a day and I'm worried that one day he will just do it. Any ways to help him (I know everyone is different but any general advice) would be appreciated.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the boyfriend's severe depression and his refusal to seek professional help or take medication. The poster expresses concern about his suicidal thoughts and the potential for self-harm. This indicates that the mental disorder in this post is related to the individual's resistance to medication and professional help in managing their depression.
Post: Lately it feels like a haven't been doing enough with my life I have no job even though I've applied to a lot of places. I rarely leave the house now and I don't feel like I have the energy to leave I feel like a drone doing the same things everyday any advice on how to break this pattern?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling unfulfilled and lacking purpose in life, as well as difficulties finding employment despite applying to many places. The poster also mentions rarely leaving the house and lacking energy to do so, suggesting a sense of stagnation and disengagement from the outside world.

"Post: Ive been after a girl for awhile and she just hugged my best friend at work. A pretty romantic hug. I just blew it off and went back to work. Well actually, I went out and had a panic attack in my truck and smashed my phone. Then i punched my door and fucked up my hand. Thats when i went inside and got back to work. It was hell watching them flirt all night, and not saying anything because i was choked up. I think im gonna stop chasing her. Im just gonna stay single, and sad. Its a hard feeling cause i hate my friend right now, but i couldnt live without him. I wish i could just be happy for him.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post describes the poster's emotional reaction to witnessing a romantic interaction between the girl they've been pursuing and their best friend.

"Post: I'm 18 and have never really been able to make any friends. I spent this new year alone again. Hearing about my parents talking with old school friends about who used to go out with who, and asking me how my 'love life' is going keeps reminding me of how unlikely it is I'm ever going to function in society. My parents met and started going out when they were younger than me and I'm still a virgin. My ssris don't cure my loneliness and only help in a superficial, enough energy to get out of bed sort of way. Idk why I'm posting this but I really just want to die, I have since I was 11 and have thought about it just about every day since I was around 13. I just don't see anything to look forward to in life. Every day I wake up and force myself to go to the gym, then sit around all day trying to find something good to watch or get enough energy to do something productive, then lie in bed and can never fall asleep within 6 hours. Even youtube sucks now. I'm so sleep deprived and lonely, hopefully I'll just die from a heart attack or a stroke or something. I don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong, it seems to come to most people so naturally - socialising - but I guess I'm just not one for life.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's difficulty in making friends and feeling lonely. They express a sense of despair, mentioning thoughts of wanting to die and feeling like they are not functioning in society. The post also discusses the poster's parents talking about their own social lives and relationships, which contributes to the feeling of inadequacy and isolation.

Post: Recently made a post about how I was going to stop self harming it's now 12:45 no one has wished me a happy new year not my parents or the freinds I believed cared about me. This has just showed me that no one truly cares and I'm about ready to give up I have spent the last year when I was at my worst making sure that I made the people I work with happy and when I needed help the most I have been forgotten by everyone I have never been so upset and let down I no longer care about faking a smile fuck everything  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling alone and neglected on New Year's, which suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from others.

They mention making up an imaginary party to avoid socializing and express a preference for being depressed alone rather than forcing themselves to be social. This suggests a feeling of alienation and a desire to avoid social situations, which could be causing mental disorders for the poster."

"Post: I've had help from the nhs as a teenager for my mental health, specifically with anxiety in the past but I think it just made these issues worse due to the medications and the general misunderstanding I recieved from doctors. Im 18 now and feel like I need to do something because I want to die and have been depressed for almost a decade and can't see any way of things getting better. Its just terrifying because I dont think I can cope with all the drama involved in trying to get help in this country, and its only supposed to be worse as an adult. I'm really sorry cause I know its so much harder for some people in other countries. I don't really know why I'm posting, I just don't know who to talk to. I just feel really on my own and don't know what to do.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's negative experience with medication and feeling that it made their mental health issues worse. They also express a desire to receive help but feel overwhelmed by the process and potential drama involved. This suggests that medication-related side effects and perceived misunderstanding from doctors are contributing factors to the poster's mental disorders.
"Post: I get this shit all the time. I'm not allowed to complain about my job because ""That's just how it is"". I tried opening up about recent depressive episode, I felt like I'd been kicked in the nuts because after weeks of work getting myself back on my feet my reward was my shitty ass job. The response I get from my family ""Suck it up, we've all been there"". I took a long hard fucking look at them, none of them are happy. They're just permanently angry. They're angry at people who have it better, yeah sometimes someone else gets lucky, but they're always just fucking resentful, never supportive. They think they're so much better, if they're better why are they angry? Why are they constantly complaining? If they're better than their managers, their bosses, their peers who got a promotion or the neighbours that have a stable family, why are they the ones with the loveless marriage, the ones that are passed up for promotions? They get fucking angry when I take time off for mental illness, ""If you're not in a mental hospital you're well enough to go to work"". Knowing them if I did go back to the psych ward they'd probably berate me for stealing money off of the NHS. I'd be open to them having issues that need to be worked out too, but I have no sympathy for them if they're gonna shit on other mentally ill folk instead of fixing themselves. And if not? Fuck you. Just because you spend your time being angry, finding ways to put others down and digging yourself a bigger rut doesn't mean I have to. Yeah, I'm depressed, but so fucking what? I know I'm going to accomplish way more than they ever will. I spent the past week crying myself to sleep again. Need to go back to the Doctor and re-evaluate my meds, I don't know when I'll be able to go back to work full-time and I don't have any money for anything other than basic food and medication, but you know what? At least I'm not some self-righteous cunt who lives to ruin someone else's life. Fuck em. I'm gonna cry again tonight, most likely, but I'm not gonna blame it on someone else. I'm gonna fix my shit and at the very least not drag someone else down with me if I fail. I'm so glad my Mom is one of the few genuinely caring people in this family. God knows I'd go insane without her support. It certainly makes up for everyone else.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a number of relationship-related issues that are likely contributing to the poster's mental disorders. They discuss feeling unsupported and invalidated by their family members, who dismiss their struggles with mental illness and are constantly angry and resentful. The post also mentions a loveless marriage and feeling thankful for the support of their mother, suggesting that romantic and family relationships are significant factors in their mental health. Overall, the post indicates a lack of positive and supportive relationships, which likely contributes to their mental disorders."
"Post: Happy new year. A time when we both look toward the future and look backwards to the past. My future is a dark plcew, a horrible place of nothing but additional resonsibility, more expecttion, and yt more grief, more dissapointmnt, and more angisih. I feel as though I died many years ago. I am now thirty years old, and yet I attempted suicide in my late teens and early twenties. After theray and drugs, and finding true love, I recovered. But this is not story of a mistreated hero. I am no antgonist of fiction, striving to overcome hardship. My hardship is of my own doing. My heartache is of my own creation. It is cliche to say that it is because I broke up with a girl. I broke her heart and now she is nothing mre than a distant memory. I am 30 now, but I figure I broke up with her about 6 or seven year ago. We were together for six years. I'd love to say I was different then but I'm quite sure I was more or less as I am now. This was the kind of love you find once in a lifetime. I have never communicated with one I felt so in tune with. I have never had someone be so patient with my issues. She forgave all my flaws and yet encouraged me to do better. For a while she made me feel as though I was someone ele. I told her I knew if we ever broke up it would be my fault, but she never believed me. I'm writing this now as an older man, supposedly moved on, supposedly mre sccesful. I am supposed to have learned and lived and fund new relationships. Many years ago she forgave me, and yet I feel mre and more grief as the years roll by. You see lthough I knew that I was incredibly lucky to have found love with oe such as her, I was totally and inexroably unfaithful. This woman loved me. I know this because she put up wit my flaws, and she taught me lie lessons I still repeat today. She is now with a man, or at least he was th last time we spoke, which was around three years ago. She looked healthy last I saw her, when she was with some new guy called Dave, and I noticed she looked so much healthier than I had ever seen her. She was so much more lifeike, confident, and vibrant than she ever was with me. I don't know if she is still with him. I a't brjng myself to messga eher, although not a minute of my waking life passes that she doesn't cross y mind. I miss her so much. Let me tell you that I miss her so very much. I have never told anyone close to me that I miss her, and even if I did tell any of my close confidants, I know no one from the time in which I know the girl I love, so to them it means very littele. More tan enanything in this world I miss her and I cannot possibly type this enough for it to portray how much I feel it. One night, 6 year ago or so, I ucked some other girl. I got drunk with a couple of friends on a randm nght out, lost contrl of my senses and my mind. Another girl, some stranger, some nothing, ws flirting with me, and through a series of terribe decisions I ended up sleeping with her within a couple of hours of meeting er As son as I it was done, I relaised what I had done. I called my ex, I tld her in no uncertain terms what I had done. THt I had cheated on her. I had slept with a stranger. I had been drunk. The scream. The scream of sheer angusih I heard down that phone haint s me even no. I cannot explain to you how much that killed me, istening to hr heart brek. This girl had put up with so much from me. She had gone through so much already and now this. That scream still haints me. She was on her way to the shops to pepare a nie surprise for us both when I told her this. She went back home nd I culd hear in her voice she was crying. I was staring at a wall, a foot away from it. I didn't feel like I was even me. I could hear ahe was crying. WHen she got back to her flat all I caould hear was  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of infidelity in a romantic relationship and the intense guilt and self-hatred that the poster feels as a result. They express a deep longing for their ex-partner and an inability to move on from the betrayal they caused. The post also mentions a history of suicidal thoughts and a desire to escape the pain they are experiencing. It is clear that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the relationship trauma and guilt experienced by the poster.
"Post: I just realized this today. Over the past few years I've been obsessing over random hobbies, jumping from one to the other, thinking it was just me finding new interests. But it's not. I become absorbed in the hobby to forget about everything else, and it becomes almost scary to stop. Does anyone else experience this?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior. The post simply describes a pattern of becoming obsessed with hobbies as a coping mechanism, but does not provide any information to suggest that it is related to their job or career."
"Post: Friends, On a throwaway here for now. I had to write/speak to someone so I've decided here is the best place. With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience. A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing! Now I'm desperately struggling to keep happy and I have this low to medium level of anxiety that just won't go away no matter how hard I try and think differently. I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home. The annoying thing is, 6 months ago, I wouldn't care less about being away from home! Or spending time alone! How do I go about just getting my resilience back and being able to deal with things? I wish wish wish I could be like, oh, so I have to fly out on Monday, big deal, I'll be back soon, make the most of it! I just want this anxiety to go away and leave me in peace! Thanks for listening.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's recent move with their partner and their struggles with being away from home, flying, and being alone. They mention a lack of resilience and a persistent level of anxiety that they are unable to alleviate. These concerns are likely tied to their relationship, as they mention missing their partner and struggling with being away from them. The post indicates a desire for advice on how to improve their resilience and cope with these relationship-related stressors."
"Post: I feel as if though I'm the only one has it right. I know that people should love each other. Yet people don't. No one treats anyone with respect. Everyone's is generally rude, mean, pessimistic, and hateful. I'm one of the only truly pure one I know in this world. We need to keep the pures and eliminate all the villans. Which is everyone else.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels isolated and disconnected from others in their perception of the world. They feel like they are the only one with a particular perspective, and that everyone else is inherently negative and unpleasant. This sense of alienation and disconnection is likely causing mental disorders for the poster, as they are unable to find a sense of belonging or connection with others who they perceive as villains."
"Post: Looking back, I am literally in the same spot I was a year ago (physically, as well as mentally), at one of my best-friends houses, sitting at this pc, about to play some league with her. And thats it. Im still as depressed, probably even more now, Im feeling just as awful about being here, and more with every second. I was hoping I'd find the courage to check out many months ago, but I failed to find it. Perhaps, this will finally be my year... oh well, happy new years anyways I guess  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and stuck in the same physical and mental state as the previous year. They mention being at a friend's house and playing a video game with them, but express feelings of sadness and dissatisfaction with their current situation. The poster also mentions a desire to have the courage to ""check out,"" which could be a reference to suicidal thoughts. These factors, along with the sense of isolation and disconnection from others, suggest that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to a sense of alienation."
Post: Im so fucked. I have anxiety to the point i feel i have paranoia and it leads to depression. And i just wanna be normal for once. I wanna actually live. Instead of constantly think about the bad about myself and how horrible i am. What can help me? Therapy? Meds? Can you guys help me out?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions anxiety, paranoia, and depression, which indicates that the poster is experiencing mental disorders. The mention of wanting to be normal and constantly thinking about the bad aspects of themselves suggests a deep sense of alienation and self-isolation.

Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is likely related to feelings of alienation and a lack of connection with others."
"Post: Here we are again, in the middle of the night with nothing but the thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future. I've been here so often over the last 10 years it feels like home. And has it really been 10 years? Unfortunately, yes. 10 years of depression. 10 years of anxiety issues interfering with my daily life. 5 Years out of high school and all I can count is the number of things I've fucked up. Dropped out of college. Been through 6 under-paid jobs that had me working 12 or more hours a day to exhaustion and panic attacks. That one really kills me. For the longest time panic attacks weren't something I had to worry about. I had maybe 3 from age 13 to 18. Then retail happened to me and I started having one a month. Then it turned into 1 a week. Then it turned into having problems leaving my house and jumping at the sound of a car starting. I suppose I've worked through part of that. I don't jump at everything anymore, and I managed to get out of the house some but being in public for any extended period of time still makes me nervous. I ran out of friends somewhere 2 years ago when I realized that my entire friend-group only hung around because I was a convenient source for weed and car rides. The last roomates I had were more my children than friends, since I had to constantly pick up after them to keep some organization in my living space, and constantly woke me up in the middle of the night bringing groups of drunk people over. I went straight after that. No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I still miss smoking. It gave me some amount of comfort in hard times, but you can't keep doing a thing that's killing you. Or so they say. I still have the urge to live, otherwise I would have kept the habit even when I started coughing up blood most mornings. But the period of severe anxiety and depression before I did give up everything drained what meager savings I had accumulated. I was so afraid to leave the house that I quit my job, ordered delivery every day, and tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed. There went 2k in a matter of months. What a waste. I could have bought into Bitcoin with that money. My mom had recently moved back into the state. I had no idea until she showed up on my doorstep every other day when my phone service went out. She helped me get out of the shit house I was staying in, gave me a place to stay and food for the last month, but I can tell her patience is running thin. In the beginning it was all ""OMG let me help you!"" ""We'll take you to a therapist"". That lasted all of a week before it was on to the same drivel I got growing up about getting a job. Meanwhile, I can't get even get McDonald's to call me back anymore. -.- I don't really think I need to talk to a therapist. Drugs aren't going to improve my situation all that much. Getting a call back from even the lowest of the pizza delivery places around here would help. A lack of inflation driving school tuitions and hence my student loans sky high would help. But drugs? I doubt it. If the drugs that helped me decide to STOP doing drugs didn't help, then the one's to dull my mind and make me ok with slaving for 12 hours a day on a wage that won't pay for an apartment without room-mates sure as hell aren't. But that comes too close to playing the victim for comfort. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want sympathy, I just want to do something productive that makes me not feel like shit, and lets me afford my own space. Does that sound like too much to ask? Really, someone should tell me because from my POV it doesn't, but I may not be thinking in the clearest terms anymore. My experiences of the last 5 years certainly seem to point in this direction. But whatever the case may be, thanks for reading, if you have. It's a release of some sort to put my thoughts down on paper.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's feelings of failure, loneliness, and fear of the future, which indicate a sense of alienation and disconnection from others. They mention a history of depression and anxiety, as well as past experiences with panic attacks and difficulty leaving the house, all of which point to mental disorders related to their feelings of isolation. The post also mentions a lack of support from friends and roommates, further contributing to the poster's sense of alienation. Overall, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's experience of alienation and disconnection from others."
"Post: And then my mate punched me in the face, and now I feel completely demotivated. It's like, what's the point, y'know? If I have fun, I get punched, if I'm upset, I get punched, if I say the wrong thing, I get punched, if I complain about it, I get punched! Like, what's the fucking point, y'know!?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions being punched by a friend and feeling demotivated as a result. This indicates that the relationship with the friend is causing distress and negative emotions for the poster. The constant fear of being physically assaulted, regardless of their emotional state or actions, suggests an abusive or toxic dynamic in the relationship, which is likely contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's experience of constant ups and downs in their mood, which is causing them distress. They mention feeling alone and not having anyone to go to for support, as well as feeling like they are just a pawn in other people's lives. These feelings of isolation, loneliness, and not being understood by others suggest a sense of alienation, which is likely contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: I only eat 500-800 calories a day. I wear three waist trimmers at all times and exercise 3-4 hours a day. I'm 5'8"" and weigh 105 pounds but I want to get to 100. My boyfriend says I need to stop before I hurt myself. I feel like such a fat and ugly slob and I want to cry every time I look in the mirror. Why does he want me to get fat?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: This is a difficult post to assign a label to based on the provided causes list. However, given the mention of the poster's boyfriend expressing concern about their behavior and the poster's negative body image and distorted perception of their weight, it is possible that there may be underlying mental health issues at play. It is important to note that this is a sensitive topic and professional help should be sought in cases of disordered eating or body dysmorphia. Nonetheless, based solely on the causes list provided, none of the other options seem to directly apply to this post."
"Post: I feel dead inside, like I don’t want to do anything useful and I feel like a bother to everyone. When I used to live with my father (parents have been separated since I was born) he always taught to me to bottle it all. Now that I’ve grown it’s hard to express how I feel to my family and friends. It’s even hard to admit it to myself sometimes. All I want to do is just cry, but I can’t even do that.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling dead inside and like a bother to everyone, indicating a deep sense of loneliness and a lack of connection with others. The poster also mentions difficulty expressing their emotions to their family and friends, possibly due to the teachings of their father to ""bottle it all."" This suggests a history of relationship issues and a difficulty in seeking support and validation from others, leading to their current feelings of emptiness and inability to cry."
"Post: Dealing with my friend's suicide has gotten ... Really bad. To the point of not eating very much for the last month or so. My parents had come over to help me clean on Saturday and I had a headache so I could do little to help, but I tried my best. Tylenol didn't work. My dad ended up getting upset that there's ""always something wrong with me."" He also said a bunch of other bullshit stuff about depression after I had to remind him what I'm dealing with and why I am physically not well at the moment. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom, my cat worrying outside, until they left. My mom texted me later that she had a talk with him that depression affects everyone differently, and he needs to be more understanding. I explained a little more about my dismal sleeping and eating habits, and clarifying my seemingly growing problems. Fine, we're good. Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has. Today my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about ""why don't I do x or y"" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. And then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself. ""Don't be depressed, you just have to think positive."" Fucking wish i'da thought of that 6 years ago. Or 5, or less. /S I'm on celexa but it's not working, waiting for my doctor to get my records from my old therapist so I can finish paperwork for a psychhealth evaluation. My hobbies bring me no joy, I had to quit one job, my other boss has made me feel absolutely unappreciated as an employee. At least my appetite is coming back so I'm getting back to.... Sort of normal... I just don't know how to deal with her when she does this. It's not the first time, and I'm sure it won't be the last, and I always explain very clearly why that's just simply not possible but... It just never really sets in. Any advice would be greatly appreciated at this point. I'm lost enough, I don't need to deal with this too right now.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is dealing with the aftermath of a friend's suicide and is experiencing symptoms of depression, such as loss of appetite and loss of joy in hobbies. The poster also discusses their parents' lack of understanding and empathy towards their depression, despite the fact that their mother has experienced it herself. This suggests a sense of alienation from their parents, as their parents' lack of understanding and dismissive comments about ""thinking positive"" contribute to their feelings of being misunderstood and unsupported. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is alienation."
Post: :) was a mistake not to kill myself last christmas.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post suggests the possibility of a past suicide attempt, but it does not provide any information that would lead to the conclusion that the cause of mental disorders is medication-related."
"Post: Sorry for the wall of text i really need to vent and get some help or advice. I grew up well normally i guess but as i git older and into middle school i started noticing wierd things like when i would argue with my brother he would call me retarded and small little things like people looking at me wierd,etc. when i went to alternative school for getting into trouble i was in a whole other section with other slightly off kids(there was a other section for people with much worse and noticeable illnesses? I guess) And now im a freshman more and more little things now that 2nd semester started i got put into special weight lifting (yes its for special people) but everyone in there looks normal like me and i have a freind in there aswell from that alternative school. My mental state is a piece of shit to say the least i cant concentrate for more than a minute i cant hold any conversations partly cause im socially awkward and have anxiety this has made me deppresed and suicidal while a completely shut down from the world. I do smoke weed twice every month or so and have tooken others to cope, i drink alot and heavily when i do, and smoke tobacco on the regular. Do these contribute ot relate in any way to my mental state? I need some help guys i hope this doesnt get buried imam afraid i might do something bad to myself or others as i go from deppressed to happy often but ive been mostly deporesed and down. Sorry for the brick wall.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing various social difficulties since middle school, such as being called derogatory names and feeling like people look at them weirdly. They also mention being placed in a special weight lifting class and having a friend from an alternative school. These experiences may indicate a history of bias or abuse, potentially contributing to their mental state. Additionally, they mention struggling with concentration, social awkwardness, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. They also mention using substances like weed, alcohol, and tobacco as a means of coping with their mental state. While these substances may have some impact on their mental state, the post primarily focuses on their experiences of social difficulties and their resulting mental health issues, suggesting that bias or abuse is the main cause of their mental disorders."
Post: Why is it so damn hard to find any sense of purpose? I wake up every morning feeling like a disappointing peace of garbage who can't accomplish anything and it's eating away at me. I suck at everything I try to do and I feel like I'm just a disappointment to my family. Maybe tomorrow will be better.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a lack of purpose and a sense of personal inadequacy, indicating a possible relationship with low self-esteem and feelings of disappointment. The poster also mentions feeling like a disappointment to their family, suggesting a potential source of external pressure and expectations influencing their mental state. This suggests that relationship-related factors are contributing to the mental disorders expressed in the post."
Post: How did you start into this unnecessary construct of time.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests a sense of detachment and disconnect from the concept of time. The poster refers to it as an ""unnecessary construct,"" indicating a feeling of alienation or disconnection from societal norms and expectations. This sense of alienation may be contributing to the poster's mental disorders."
"Post: I start to get my shit together, do good by eating and exercise for a couple weeks, start to feel good, then fall right back to depression. Im so tired of this. I keep doing self destructive things. What do i do  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post discusses fluctuations in mood and self-destructive behavior but does not mention any specific factors such as bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation that could be contributing to the mental disorders."
"Post: Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life. I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this. So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university. It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true. Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though. I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back. So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, as well as feelings of failure and being stuck in their current situation. They discuss a semester break they took and their interest in pursuing game development courses instead of going back to university. The poster also mentions feeling excited and motivated when working on their game development portfolio. Therefore, it can be inferred that the mental disorders in this post are related to the poster's dissatisfaction with their current academic path and their desire to pursue a career in game development instead."
"Post: I've been dealing with mild depression since October (self-diagnosed, nothing formal). I've mostly been able to deal with it. The last few months though, it's slowly getting worse. The lack of energy, loss of interest in enjoyed activities. All I do is work is come home. On the weekends, I just turn hermit and avoid things. Even doing self care doesn't help. Today, I haven't been out of bed except to go to the bathroom and eat a bagel. My roommate came in to talk and see if I was okay. He had helped me in the past deal with this, but even he's not sure what to do. In about 3 months, I'm supposed to move in with the love of my life. I'm moving to another state to do it. I know I need to start therapy, but I know changing therapists at the beginning of recovery can be dangerous. I'm so lost that I just don't know where to start.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post describes the poster's experience of mild depression that has been gradually worsening over the past few months. They mention a lack of energy, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, and isolating behavior. The poster also acknowledges the need for therapy but expresses concern about changing therapists during the early stages of recovery. Given the symptoms described and the acknowledgment of the need for therapy, medication may be necessary as a form of treatment to help manage the worsening symptoms of depression."
"Post: One year ago today, i promised myself that i will change, but i didn't change shit. feeling all broken and hopeless inside. i'm still that person. I didn't change at all. I thought i could. I thought I tried. What will the next year be, another 365 days of trying to get by with the world. So fucking tiring. I'm getting nowhere  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of hopelessness, self-disappointment, and a sense of being stuck in a cycle of not making any progress. The reference to trying to ""get by with the world"" and feeling tired suggest a disconnect and alienation from the world and a lack of progress or fulfillment in the poster's life. This sense of alienation and lack of progress is likely contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: ive lost it all, my will to live is gone and i just feel really numb at this point i hope this year kills me  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests a deep sense of despair and hopelessness. The poster feels like they have lost everything and no longer have a will to live. This overwhelming feeling of numbness and the desire for death can be indicative of a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, as well as a lack of support and meaningful relationships."
"Post: Nobody understands me so I hoped reddit could help. As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples. At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one. I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades. Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood. I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none. I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool. I forget my families birthdays. I forget basic mathmatics. I forget my address. I forget my phone number. I forget my passions. I forget my dreams. I even forget my age. I thought my cat was 1, turns out after my sister laughed for 15 minutes she told me he was 3. I love my cat. I've had dozens of people in my life tell me I'm stupid. I get bullied because of my memory loss. I get called mental almost every day. my closest friends think I am an idiot. My teachers, my parents, all of my loved ones, etc think I am stupid. I told my father this. I started crying in front of him and you know what he told me? You don't listen. I have not visited a doctor because my dad doesn't believe me. Please somebody, what is wrong with me. I go to bed at 8 and wake up at 7, I love to eat healthy because my mom force fed me salad as a child (I don't remember that), I have not had depression or anxiety until now because only now I wonder why I am this way, I do cross country, and I am an overall healthy boy. For the love of God somebody help me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions multiple instances where the poster feels misunderstood or forgotten by others, including classmates, friends, teachers, and family members. They mention being bullied and called names, as well as experiencing disbelief and lack of support from their father. These experiences indicate a lack of positive and supportive relationships in the poster's life, which may be contributing to their mental disorders and feelings of confusion and distress."

They specifically mention not being able to find a job or afford their own apartment, which can contribute to feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness. The post also mentions not having a girlfriend and feeling like they are losing everything that makes them happy.

"Post: So I'm starting to come up with coping hobbies, and I wanted to record myself talking about my depression but I feel like if I do it out loud that people in my room will think i'm a pussy.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a fear of being judged by others in the person's room if they were to talk out loud about their depression. This suggests that their concern about the perception of others in their immediate relationships is causing them distress and influencing their coping mechanisms. Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to relationships and the fear of judgment from others."
"Post: I was really happy until midnight and wanted my friends to be happy too. But after that it went straight down to doom. Not only did I hurt a woman I know, who works at the bar, but also cried infront of everyone. Worse thing, it wasn't like normal crying, it was my uncontrolable Depression-Crying. And I never did this infront of my friends. I guess I also kinda drank too much alcohol (which is why I told myself to quit it this year - wish me luck). I'm not a person to talk about my feelings, since it mostly worsen my depression. Like it does now. I feel so bad, but I pretend like I don't remember infront of the others. My friends think it was the alcohol, I guess. But it was just a side-effect, comparing to the true reason, which is, that 2017 was one of my worse years by now. I always thought, it will get better, I can stand this and become better at controlling it. But I haven't calculated failure and so I'm thrown back years. I actually think as okay of myself, but I'm suffering under the fear of what others think of me, which is so bad, when I'm thinking about new year's eve.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of depression and how talking about their feelings worsens it. They also mention feeling bad about hurting someone they know and crying uncontrollably in front of others. The post indicates a fear of what others think of them and a desire to improve and become better at controlling their emotions. These factors suggest that bias or abusive experiences, potentially related to the poster's interactions with others, may be contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to. Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic. I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow. At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design. Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do, sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways. I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side, which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking. I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough) movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability. But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail, that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life, that I cant really live life at all. So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking day? I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family. Even then, Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways. But Ive been thinking about it more often lately I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now. Thanks for reading my griping if you got this far.

"Post: Hi I think I may be got depression but today few times I have feel good. First, when I have something like flashback in class when I feel just like few months ago, when I like English lessons. Then when I have a nice conversation with friend (can person with depression even normally talk with ppl and have fun becouse of it?). I have something like a sad mood that come out of nowhere, which I feel most of time, always when I'm alone. I feel like this for few hours, always in the begining of a day and in the end.

Post: I don't know what is happening to my mind. I have got 3 panic attacks in the last 5 days. Everything is getting messed up. Things are going downhill at my home. I can't sleep at night now for the shoutings and all the fights. I can't study even though exams are coming. My soul love just got engaged to someone else and I have to see tgose the moment I step out of my house as he is my neighbour. I always wanted to go abroad and make a living as a nurse. I am falling in my grades and all my former classmates are settling down overseas. My relatives hate me because I am bad at studies and a fat and ugly girl. I can't take this anymore. And also my depression is having a great time feeding over my faliures!!  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"medication. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, and feeling overwhelmed by various stressors in their life, such as problems at home, unrequited love, poor academic performance, negative self-image, and depression.

"Post: I've never opened up before like this before so please forgive the incoming wall of text My girlfriend broke up with me a couple of months ago. We're still friends, but I can't stop thinking about her and regretting letting it happen. She is what I think about most of the day, and I am on the verge of coming back crying to her asking her to forgive me and give me another chance. She was the only one that cared about me, that didn't put me down. Even though I had many failings she still said she loved me, even after my best friend's put me down for being dumb. She was the only one that treated me as an equal and not a second rate citizen to be laughed at or to be disappointed with. I started uni this year. I've had fun but made close to no friends and it feels really superficial. I don't know if I like it but there's no way I can go back now, my parents will fucking disown me even if I try, even though I'm at a second rate uni wasting my time. The people I talk to most are still my friends from school and my now ex. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I am never happy. I tried getting help from my email by applying for councilling but they took a month to reply and when I turned up there was no one there. I am so lonely. I have no more will to continue. I can't end it but if I could I would. The weather makes me feel like shit. The success of all my friends compared to how much of a fucking FAILURE I am makes me feel like shit. I have no one to turn to. Most nights I can't even sleep and when I do only for a few hours at a time. I will do shit in my exams. I still go through life but I feel like an empty vessel. My parents are disappointed in me. My younger sister makes fun of me. People avoid me. I try to be an interesting person and someone to invite to parties but it just seems whatever I do people reject me. I just want this to end. I want to be happy and live life. This is meant to be the best time of my life, so why is the best thing in my life the fact that I got a decent amount of karma on a post on my main? How fucking pathetic do I have to be to actually be proud of that? I just want to start life again and have a second chance at everything so I won't be just a fucking disgrace anymore. I'm sorry, I just want everything to end  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the breakup with the poster's girlfriend and the lingering feelings of regret and longing for her. They also express feelings of loneliness and disappointment in their social interactions, both at university and with friends from school. The post mentions crying themselves to sleep, feeling like a failure, and contemplating the end of their life. These feelings of hopelessness and despair are likely rooted in the relationship issues and a lack of social connection, making the assigned label of relationship the most appropriate cause for the mental disorders in this post."

"Post: 60 mg Cymbalta, 6 mg Vraylar, 300 mg Lithium. The side effects are a drag, but I wouldn't mind them if my depression was nullified. I just can't seem to find my vitality. Have any of you had success with alternate approaches? What do you guys do to get ""up and at 'em"" and stay that way? I'm just tired of harboring suicidal thoughts. Been struggling off and on for over a decade. Just want to reach out and say something. Thanks.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication.

"Post: Is... Is this really a thing? Another post recently had a reply pointing this out as a possibility of being a thing. My life isn't bad. It's not great, I'm not homeless and I have food and a roof... But I just feel like everything is wrong so often. If left to my own thoughts I sit and dwell on all I;m done wrong, how I may have upset people that day, do people actually care? Am I being manipulated for their gain and it's all fake 'love' towards me? I don't know what's wrong. I sit and cry for no reason just because nothing feels correct or right, but I don't know what's wrong about it. I'm afraid of upsetting people so I always shrink back at conflict. I'm afraid of seeming too needy so I never tell people when something is wrong. I have someone I care about, but I'm so afraid of burdening them with more problems about myself, when they have their own stuff to deal with anyway. It's not a... 'relationship' in the common use of the word, but someone that is important to me, so I don't feel I have the right to pester them or drag them down. And what would I tell them anyway? ""I'm uspet because nothing is right, but I don't know what right is, so I don't even know it's wrong anyway?"" That doesn't work... I'm not suicidal. I have no right to be. I don't think I have half the problems those that stand on that cliff must have in their life, so how could I possibly consider doing that? I just want to sleep so much. When I'm asleep I don't think, I don't dwell on how I feel. It's so dumb. I worry over even stupid stuff in video games with friends. I switched servers in a game recently, and I still contact and talk to all the people from the old server, but I still felt sick as I did it. I sat and cried over slighting those that I left behind on the old server, because I left them behind. Is this dumb shit I sit and think and do Depression? These thoughts of being worth nothing, thoughts that I'm hurting everyone around me by existing, forcing them to interact with me like I'm the unwanted little brother of your best friend that his mom forced him to bring along to play with. But now I have to wonder if I just manufacture all this myself. Make myself feel negative about myself to get... whatever I get out of that. Loop it around, driving myself more and more downward. I dunno why I posted this really. Maybe I just want people to at least see that I'm not all there. I tried so hard to hide that from those I care about, that maybe nobody knew something was wrong for the longest time. So... Thanks for reading this.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling like everything is wrong and dwelling on negative thoughts and emotions. The poster questions if people actually care about them and if their relationships are genuine. They express a fear of burdening others and being seen as needy, leading them to keep their problems to themselves. They also mention a lack of understanding of what is right or wrong and feeling like they don't have the right to express their emotions. These feelings of isolation and disconnection from others, as well as doubts about their worth and the authenticity of their relationships, suggest that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to a sense of alienation."
"Post: I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom. I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger. I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life. I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable. We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it. I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14. I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself. Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend. Some health problems I have are: I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long. There isn't really a cure for it. things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety: I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back. For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything. I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores. I still don't have a driver's liscense. I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger. I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help. Talking about my depression does nothing. The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression. I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants. I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run. The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer. I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work. A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety. I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression. I hate living with my mom. I am good at saving and am very cheap. A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead. Any help is greatly appreciated.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors related to the individual's mental health, including social anxiety, severe depression, anger, and a desire to enjoy life and find a girlfriend. The poster also mentions health problems such as cholinergic urticaria, which affects their ability to engage in physical work or stand for long periods of time. They discuss their attempts to manage their symptoms, including healthy eating, exercise, and medication. They mention seeing psychologists and therapists but not finding helpful solutions. The poster specifically asks for advice on what type of job or career would be suitable for someone with social anxiety and physical limitations. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is likely related to the individual's struggles with finding a job or career that accommodates their mental and physical limitations."

"Post: That have never had a fun New Years? No one invites me to anything and it just feels fucking horrible. I asks people if they're doing anything and I just get a ""Idk"" and then on new years I see that they're on a cool party or something that seems nice.

"Post: I struggle with clinical depression, anxiety, and now I think I have PTSD. I moved a way for school and I had a hard time adjusting to this new life and making friends. Dated a guy in this new city and we broke up a few days ago. He is my fucking roommate (yes I know bad fucking idea). Dealing with all this, I fell back into a depression and I decided that today I will go back to the hospital and get back on meds. I’m tired of the constant shaking feeling, the panic attacks, the tears, not being able to sleep, not being able to eat. I’m tired of feeling like I’m always in danger. I just cant do this by myself anymore and I’m gonna try and get help as soon as I can. I want to feel better and I know these feelings aren’t forever.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none.

"Post: so my gums feel like a spaceship but anyway i just want everything to go away. if i die nothing good happens again. if i live i have to keep dealing with this shit. if i go to rehab i lose the only thing ever made me happy. If I tell him how i feel he'll frseak out again if I dont i'll probably kill myself because God Damn i am lonely! I am G-O-N-E. Have been for a long time. Everyone thinks I'm all better. sobriety is fucking dumb and its impossible to be happy without railing a line first but like its gonna drive away everyone i know. you know? I can have dopamine and be lonely as shit or I can have a bunch of friends and be on the brink of suicide at all times. Either way the future looks shit btw ive tried everything esle, all kinds a therapy and meds and I exercise and eat healthy but my brain still fucking sucks  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling lonely and desperate for connection, expressing a sense of hopelessness and contemplating suicide. The poster also mentions previous attempts at therapy, medication, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle without success in improving their mental state. This suggests that the root cause of their mental disorders may be related to their struggles with relationships and a lack of meaningful connections with others."
"Post: Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard. I'm going to go do that list of morning stuff, because at least it'll keep things from getting worse. But I just wish it didn't feel so futile.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling overwhelmed by daily tasks and responsibilities, such as feeding pets, cleaning the house, and doing laundry. The poster expresses anxiety and a sense of futility in trying to keep up with these responsibilities, despite not having additional factors like children or intense work hours. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders is related to the stress and pressure they feel in managing their job and career responsibilities, as well as the constant feeling of never being able to catch up or find fulfillment in their daily tasks."
"Post: It's 500 out of pocket each time I go to the doc, for appointment, because it's out of pocket. Shit man, I don't know if I'm worth it. I'm a drain on my family and everyone.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions the financial burden of going to the doctor and feeling like a drain on their family and others. This suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection, where the poster may feel like they are causing a burden on others and are not worth the resources or support. This feeling of alienation and self-perception can contribute to mental disorders."

It does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, a sense of alienation, or relationship issues as contributing factors to their mental health concerns."
"Post: Knowing what to do and not to do is the ultimate power. I guess it could get boring knowing exactly what's coming but I could fix everything and not be where I'm at today.

Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions the desire to fix broken family relationships and to stop an abusive father, suggesting a history of bias or abuse within the family. The mention of punching bullies in their faces also implies a response to past incidents of bias or abuse."
"Post: My neck started hurting lately and when I went out yesterday I felt like I can't keep my head up. I'm really concerned if it is because I lie in bed too much or if it's something else? I have been out of school for a while but I'm thinking just like you gain muscle when you work out, I am losing muscle because I am not doing normal human functioning? This is making me worried. Does anyone else get this?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none.

"Post: So I started therapy a couple weeks ago, and I just dont feel like it works at all. My mother drives me 30-45 minutes away, for me to sit in a couch in front of a professional, while I only say one-word sentences. My therapist suggested journaling. She said she would read them if I let her, so maybe I say it on paper and give it to her tomorrow, and hopefully I can get this mess sorted out.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions starting therapy and feeling like it is not working. The poster also mentions their mother driving them to therapy sessions, indicating a relationship dynamic with their mother. The suggestion of journaling and possibly sharing it with the therapist implies a desire for a deeper connection and communication in the therapist-patient relationship. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is related to relationship issues."
"Post: I feel like the only reason I haven't already found the courage to do it is my two younger siblings. I'm sixteen, and they are twelve and ten respectively. I know that my parents would be heartbroken, but that would only be two people. My ""friends"" would be over it in a few weeks anyway. I feel like my brother and sister would be too emotionally damaged or traumatised if I did it, and I don't want to cause any more pain to anyone anymore. This is my first post here, so let me know if I fucked it up. thx  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling suicidal and considering self-harm, but hesitating due to the presence of younger siblings. This suggests that the poster may be experiencing a mental disorder such as depression or anxiety, which may benefit from medication as a treatment option."
Post: I know I sound weak a d pathetic for this but my parents are splitting and I have no idea how to even cope with it. I am losing my hope and I don't know how even face a day. At the moment I think the only way out is to kill myself and I don't think anyone would care. There is really nothing left for me to enjoy maybe I deserve to suffer and kill myself...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's parents splitting up and their feelings of hopelessness and thoughts of suicide. This indicates that the cause of their mental disorder is likely related to the breakdown of their family relationships and the emotional distress it has caused them.

"Post: I'm currently going through some hard times and have no emotion towards it. I have ME (mialgic ensephilomitis), ME makes you become very tired very quickly to the extent that at times it even inhibits the ability to properly think. I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent. So I am wondering if my lack of emotion is normal or not? Is there anything I can do about it because it feels very unnatural.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's condition of ME (mialgic ensephilomitis) and how it has led to feelings of extreme fatigue and difficulty thinking. They discuss being removed from school due to their condition and feeling as though they have been frozen in time while the rest of the world continues moving forward. This sense of isolation and lack of progress can be contributing to their mental disorders. They also mention going through depression initially but now feeling a lack of emotions, including empathy towards others. This emotional numbness and difficulty feeling any emotions may be related to the impact that their condition and inability to pursue a normal career or educational path has had on their overall well-being and mental health. Therefore, the cause of their mental disorders in this post is related to their jobs and career."
"Post: I’m tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it’s kind of my life story lol. I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She’s not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I’d never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she’s the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn’t go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was “That’s not good,” and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I’ve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it’ll stop hurting so much. What’s even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master’s degree. She’s very school smart and has always done very well. I’m going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I’m going to support her but I’m afraid I’m just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I’m so scared I’m going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She’s so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she’s just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I’ve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I’ve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I’ve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can’t get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions a series of negative experiences related to school and college. The poster describes feeling isolated and struggling academically, leading to dropping out of college. They express feelings of failure and compare themselves to their successful friends and girlfriend. They also mention working a retail job and feeling like they will never be successful. These experiences and negative thoughts related to their education and career suggest that the mental disorders in this post are caused by jobs and career factors."
"Post: Hi everyone I'm new to this sub but I just need some help with my change. For two years I have been actively self harming whether it was cutting or doing other bad stuff. I had friends that tried to help but I could never get myself to stop. Recently I found myself in a really positive relationship and because I love my boyfriend, I agreed to give him my blades and he promised he would keep them out of reach. I did this because I feel okay knowing they still exist even if I can't get to them. I could never get myself to throw them away. But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury. For anyone who has successfully quit cutting, how did you do it? Because right now, two weeks in, I only feel so much worse.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of self-harming behaviors and the poster's inability to quit despite the support of friends. They also mention being in a new relationship and giving their blades to their boyfriend as a means of trying to stop self-harming. However, they are now experiencing increased depression and a lack of alternative coping mechanisms. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder is related to their relationship, as the change in their self-harming behavior and reliance on their partner for support has not effectively addressed their underlying emotional struggles."
"Post: So I have rapid cycling bipolar 2 which is a less severe form of bipolar. Anyway, for the past few days I have been manic and it has been worse than it usually is for me. basically, what happened was I started snap chatting girls and complementing them and stuff. I started yelling at people telling them to shut the fuck up because their voices were annoying. that sort of thing. but the thing that I ma the most concerned about is the snapchatting of the girls. I have a girlfriend. I love my girlfriend literally more than anything and it hurts me to know that there is a part of me that would do something like that. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I'm just a piece of shit that should go die in hell. but this is really killing me and I don't know what to do. she has literally loved me so much and been there for me through everything in my life. and I have done this in return. I guess it technically doesn't count as cheating, but none the less it is still a really shitty thing for me to do. what the fuck should I do with myself now. is it really even my fault? I don't know please help me someone  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that the person has rapid cycling bipolar 2 and that their recent manic episode has been more severe than usual. They describe engaging in impulsive behavior such as snap chatting other girls and yelling at people. They express guilt and remorse for their actions, particularly for potentially betraying their girlfriend. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders in this post is related to their bipolar disorder and the difficulties they are experiencing in managing their symptoms, potentially indicating a need for medication adjustment or additional support."
"Post: My son is the only thing that keeps me going...but it is so hard to hide the depression and anxiety of it all. Money is the root of most of my problems...I am currently working 3 jobs. I am overwhelmed and worn out. I am incredibly thankful every day that he is such an amazing kid and that my nonsense hasn't messed him up completely. But, I get so worn out and done with life. I just don't have a light at the end of the tunnel, but I hope that I have created that light for him and when he heads off to college in a year, he can live his best life and surpass me in every way. Thank you for letting me vent. I am just feeling at the end of a long rope recently. It is a dark hole.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's overwhelming workload of working three jobs, which is likely causing feelings of being overwhelmed and worn out. They also mention that money is the root of most of their problems, indicating that job-related financial stress is likely a significant contributor to their mental disorders. The post also expresses a sense of hopelessness and a lack of a light at the end of the tunnel, which can be related to the stress and exhaustion caused by their multiple jobs."
"Post: I’d like to preface this post by saying if it appears that I am trolling, I am not, but I realise some of these points may seem illegitimate. I watched frozen for the first time recently. Being a 20 year old man, I realised I wasn’t in the target audience for it, but I watched it nonetheless as I had nothin better to do. As I watched it I found myself strangely entranced. I enjoyed this innocence of it but it was strangely alien to me, like I’d never experienced something like it before. It got me thinking about my childhood, which I’ve not long departed, and yet have rarely reflected upon. I thought about how alien frozen was to me, and how I lacked anything like it when I was growing up. I was never shown Disney or Pixar films in my infancy, unlike, dare I say, most people my age. I summed this up to spending very little time with my mother due to her illnesses that rendered her incapable of caring for me in my formative years. Instead, I spent them in the care of my grandparents, who were very kind to me, yet it was not the same as having parents as my friends did. It wasn’t until I was around 13 or 14 when my mother took over full time care of me, by which time it was too late for me to gather the classically happy childhood memories I feel I’m lacking. Even when she took over my care, she was not really the perfect mother, not for lack of trying but due to a lack of experience, (she had me when she was very young compared to the average). She couldn’t afford to rent a particularly nice place to stay, in fact it was so run down that I was too embarrassed to invite friends over. Sometimes she invited friends for me by asking their parents, but I soon put a stop to that when I discovered they’d been talking about my house behind my back, commenting on how grotty it was compared to their middle class mansions in the suburbs. Times got so bad that, on multiple occasions, I remember being told to get on the floor and to be quiet whilst debt collectors hammered on the door in search of our meagre possessions to settle debts for necessities like electricity and gas. I never knew my father either, in fact I didn’t even know his name until about 2 years ago, when I found it out from my birth certificate. I then googled it and discovered he was a convicted paedophile which sent me into a downward spiral of self identity crisis. I always felt this lack of knowledge of where I come from. Friends who didn’t understand would often ask me if I missed my dad or not and bullies who found out the information would often use it to their advantage. I guess all in all what I’m trying to say is I feel unsatisfied with my childhood, but I was never abused, verbally or physically. I was never homeless or reliant on food banks, despite being close on several occasions. I was always taught to be grateful for what I have. Like that classic quote says, “If you have running water and a refrigerator, you’re better off than half of the worlds population.” I’ve always hated lines like that, I’ve certainly never felt better off, and even less so when compared to my peers. I quote that comes to mind is “I never wanted more than everyone else, just not the less I was used to.” I don’t know if I’m being melodramatic or if I have legitimate reasons to feel cheated. I guess I’m just struggling with moving past darker days right now... * Typed on my phone, so apologies for any lapse in spelling and/or grammar  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's dissatisfaction with their childhood and feelings of being cheated in comparison to their peers. They mention being raised by their grandparents instead of their mother, experiencing financial difficulties, living in a run-down house, being embarrassed to invite friends over, and receiving comments from others about their living situation. The post also talks about the lack of knowledge about their father and discovering his criminal history, which led to a self-identity crisis. These experiences and feelings of being different and disadvantaged compared to their peers indicate that relationship-related factors, such as a lack of parental support and a sense of social alienation, may be contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: It just blows my mind. Are there really people out there that wake up, don't continue to lay in bed, and just start doing things? I dunno how they do it. I don't get how someone could enjoy whatever their hobbies are, and enjoy them without ever stopping due to how pointless it is, or how pointless all of life is. I can't imagine what it's like to have a family that loves you, or to be an important person to anyone else. Some people can get so much out of life with minimal effort, and all I can really do is lay in bed and cry about how nothing makes me feel good, how I can't enjoy anything, and how incredibly lonely and alien I feel. Classic question: Why me?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of alienation and a sense of being disconnected from others. The poster expresses difficulty in understanding how people can enjoy their hobbies or have loving families, and describes feeling incredibly lonely and alienated from others. This sense of alienation and disconnection is likely contributing to the mental disorders described in the post."
Post: i know running away from your problems is bad but i need to get out of town i need to go on a trip i need it  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is feeling the need to escape or get away from their current situation. They express a desire to leave town and go on a trip, which indicates a sense of alienation or disconnection from their current environment. They may be feeling overwhelmed or trapped by their problems and believe that getting away will provide some relief or a fresh perspective."
"Post: And as much as it hurts and exhausts you, you let them. For me it's because the pain is better dealt with an ""ok"" than them becoming upset at my ""no, I'm not fine"" and starting an argument. It's just what I'm used to - I'm in a loop of an imaginary consistent bell ringing that reminds me to people please. For you it could be to feel, to feel the pain because you can't feel happiness anymore. Or because of guilt, your own and what others put on you. Or simply, it's because that's all you've ever known. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I feel like I belong in a mental hospital with the thoughts that run through my head. I wish you all a better year in 2018, I really do.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's tendency to prioritize others' needs and feelings over their own, out of fear of upsetting or starting arguments with them. They describe being in a loop of people-pleasing and feeling guilt. The post also mentions feeling like they belong in a mental hospital due to the thoughts running through their head, implying a significant level of distress. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their relationships and their tendency to prioritize others at the expense of their own well-being."
Post: My greatest solution has always been to just sleep but these days I can't even do it that easily. Second best was video games but no matter how happy I am for my character I will always come back to the fact that it's all virtual and real life isn't that beautiful. Music was also something that helped a lot but I have no mood to play or sing and listening to it makes me sadder most of the time. Being at work has helped me take my mind off things but when I get home it's the same thing all over. It really feels like there's nothing else to do so I'm hoping that you guys can help me out. Lots of love to everyone.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions several activities that the poster used to find solace in, such as sleeping, playing video games, and listening to music. However, they express that these activities no longer bring them joy and instead make them feel sadder. This suggests a sense of disconnection and alienation from activities and hobbies that used to provide comfort. The post also mentions feeling stuck and hopeless, indicating a lack of fulfillment and a need for support and connection with others. Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is likely related to a sense of alienation and disconnection from enjoyable activities and a lack of fulfillment in life."
"Post: I'm a dude, almost 19 years old, and I live with my parents. I don't work, I've quit college right after joining ( this past fall ) and I very rarely get out of the house. I spend my time playing video games and watching youtube videos. I frequently ask myself what would happen if my parents kicked me out, if I truly was alone and had to fend for myself. Am I just a spoiled lazy kid, or is what I'm claiming real. I DO feel shitty sometimes, but I'm in a sort of hibernation the rest of the time if that makes any sense. I DO remember having real issues with anxiety, finding it incredibly hard to talk to people at times but right now it doesn't really feel like anything. I have a couple of really good friends but I don't really like hanging out with them anymore. I've just sort of accepted where I'm at right now. I've talked to my friends about depression but even though they could relate and have issues of their own, I feel like they're still going forward with life. I want to know for sure that I'm not just making shit up and what I feel is real but I'm not sleeping 19 hours a day, I'm not a junkie and I haven't attempted suicide. I want to get better and I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now but I'm really afraid that I might just be a prick.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors related to the poster's lack of motivation and sense of stagnation in life. They mention not working or attending college, spending most of their time playing video games and watching YouTube videos, and feeling unsure about their future. They also mention having issues with anxiety and difficulty socializing with people. These factors suggest that the cause of the poster's mental disorders is related to their lack of direction in their jobs and career, as well as their feelings of isolation and lack of fulfillment."
"Post: I had a failed suicide attempt on Christmas, and since then, I’ve been “glad” to be alive but so violently depressed My birthday, the 26th, was spent working and alone. Nobody remembered it, as always. My New Years is also going to be spent alone. I’m out of my anxiety meds, and have to wait until January to get more. I want to cry all the time. Even trying to get myself to wash my hair is hard. I can’t even do that most of the time. I can only sit here wishing I was crying, but nothing is coming out. It’s just tough right now guys. I haven’t had interaction with anyone other than coworkers, and my parents for weeks. My mother, who I take care of, doesn’t believe depression is even crippling. She takes it as a stunned toe, “just walk it off”. I’m ready to feel normal again. I’m tired of wanting any kind of attention just to feel loved for even a split second. I feel so absolutely useless in this world, but I’m too exhausted to want to kill myself again. It’s more of a “I’m glad to be alive I guess but if something killed me right now I would be okay” My life is a mess  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a failed suicide attempt and ongoing depression since then. They also mention feeling alone on their birthday and New Year's, and not having interaction with anyone other than coworkers and their parents. The poster's mother's disbelief in the severity of depression and their longing for attention and feeling loved suggest relationship issues as a cause for their mental disorders. The lack of support and understanding from their mother, as well as the absence of meaningful social connections, contribute to their feelings of uselessness and desire for normalcy."
"Post: I try so hard to feel happy. I really do. Ive tried the “fake it till you make it” method and it hurts to keep going that way. I really dont know what to do anymore. I try telling my mom and she just says i need to stop thinking im depressed b/c im actually not. Which makes me feel pathetic. I try reaching out for help but when i do, they just make it about themselves and how selfish I am. I have an appointment tomorrow for a psychological evaluation and i am really nervous. Yes i have been diagnosed before and have taken medication. But i was already getting off most of them. And now im falling down again. I just want to get better. I want to feel genuinely happy.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's attempts to feel happy and their struggle with the ""fake it till you make it"" method. They also mention reaching out for help but feeling dismissed and invalidated by their mom and others. The post indicates a sense of isolation and feeling like they can't find the support they need. This sense of alienation and disconnection is likely contributing to their mental disorders and their desire to feel genuinely happy."
"Post: College has been the worst experience for me. I started out at a community college and then transferred to a small city college in my town that I commute to. First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it. Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started. And everyone I went to high school with are graduating now which makes me feel so much worse. I still don't even know what I want to major in. And I really don't want to stay here for two or three more years to finish a degree. Can anyone relate?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's experience with depression starting when they began college. They also mention trying different courses and feeling unsure about their major. This suggests that the mental disorders in this post are likely related to the poster's struggles with mental health and their medication may be playing a role in managing their depression symptoms.
"Post: i build up shells to stop people from seeing who i am. i may seem happy but thats just an act, if people saw who i really am theyd put me away in some hospital. I sit here blood on my legs out of the cuts that i madea My shell is breaking I cant do anythind nobody can knwo idon tknow what to do anyt more  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions self-harm and a fear of being admitted to a hospital if people were to see who the poster really is. This indicates that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of a mental disorder, such as depression or borderline personality disorder. They also mention building up walls and acting happy as a means of hiding their true emotions, suggesting a need for emotional regulation or stabilization. The mention of self-harm and feeling overwhelmed indicates that medication may be necessary to manage these symptoms and provide support for the poster."
"Post: im a 16 year old girl from england. ive attempted suicide 6 times in the space of (almost) 2 years because of school. my head of year is supposed to help students with anxiety and let us sit outside her office but she just tells me to go away. i told her i was going to kill myself and she just told me to stop being dramatic. im feeling really suicidal right now, and i want to tell my mum because im scared im going to hurt myself, but she’ll just think im attention seeking. i really dont know what to do. i start school in the morning at 7.30am and its 11:54pm right now.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of attempted suicide due to school-related issues and mentions a lack of support from the head of year who dismisses their concerns.

"Post: So this girl and I have been talking a while and I slowly started liking her more, I have extreme emotions and the only one I learned to control was anger so my other ones go Willy nilly, I haven't been diagnosed because they don't know what to diagnose it as. She started off by giving very blatant signals, so we started being flirty etc I asked her out and the date is in a few days, she was my +1 to a new year's party and we cuddled most of the time and kissed and as she left I walked her to the car. Then I talked to her yesterday morning and I haven't talked to her since but she has seen my message. I know I'm overreacting and over thinking but I can't get over all my stress and anxiety about it, I realize it's likely nothing but I'm very stressed out. Update: were 17 so her mom found out there was pot at new year's and said she can't go on our dinner and movie date but we will be going on a lunch date  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The initial post mentions the poster's emotional difficulties and struggles with controlling their extreme emotions, specifically noting that anger is the only emotion they have learned to control. They also mention their interactions and developing feelings for a girl, as well as their stress and anxiety related to the uncertainty of the relationship. The update reveals that the girl's mother has prohibited her from going on a previously planned dinner and movie date due to an incident involving marijuana at a New Year's party. This further highlights the role of the relationship and the difficulties and stress it is causing for the poster. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's emotional struggles and the stress and uncertainty within their relationship."
"Post: I'm reading /r/depression alot these days and I noticed almost everyone here is feeling lonely, including myself. Sometimes you just want to talk (about it) without getting judged. I'm planning on starting a WhatsApp groupchat with 5/6 people in it. We can talk about daily struggles but also daily life and support eachother. Become friends. I am not a professional, nor am I thinking this will end our depression, I just think it would be really nice to have some people together to support you. If you would like to join the chat, contact me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling lonely and wanting to talk without judgment, indicating a sense of isolation from others. The poster expresses a desire to create a group chat to connect with others who are also experiencing depression and to provide support for each other. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder is related to a feeling of alienation and a lack of connection with others."
Post: What do you think?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post does not provide any specific information or context that would suggest any of the listed causes as the reason for mental disorders.

The response is therefore ""None."""
"Post: I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now. You see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. For example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has been a  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the difficulties and conflicts the poster is experiencing related to medication. They discuss their parents' insistence on alternative medicine and the potential dangers associated with it. The post also mentions the dangers associated with the medication for MS, such as the development of diabetes and thyroid disease in others. The poster expresses frustration, feelings of being beaten down, and the impact of the ongoing fights and stress on their mental health. Therefore, it is clear that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the medication issues and conflicts surrounding it."
"Post: I've been on 2 different meds in the past, and they either didn't work, or wore off after a few months so I never went back to the doctor to try others. That was years ago and now my depression is worse than ever. I'm wondering whether it's worth trying other meds. Even if there is one out there that works for me, it could takes years of trial and error before I find it. So, I'm just wondering what other people's experience with meds is. Any of you tried everything and found nothing works?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",medication.

"Post: I grabbed a pile of old pictures that were close to my heart and pills. I locked the door and layed out the pictures which included pictures of my mom when she was young me as a kid my dad and my siblings.

This time last year, she was involved in an incident where she was assaulted (we were not dating at the time), and it is bringing up some bad memories for her.

"Post: Recently I got together with my long time on and off close guy friend from high school. We hadn't talked in over half a year because I blocked him due to the fact that I felt he was constantly leading me on. A couple of months ago he found a way to reach out to me and I ended up calling him and we met up. I ended up kissing him, which is not my nature because I would like to wait till marriage to do anything sexual. Kissing is not too much of a big deal for me but it is something special. I began talking to him again and we would hang out and kiss. I had an emotional breakdown in front of him at one point and that is when I realized that I really liked him. I decided it was time for us to have a talk about where our relationship was going because I had many boundaries and he had many expectations that crossed those boundaries. I finally had a talk with him where he didn't take me very seriously and constantly made jokes about sex and how that's what he wanted from me, till I realized he wasn't merely joking, the things he said had a lot of truth to them. I felt very stupid for being so oblivious to the fact that this man that I have known since high school was such a dirt bag. I ended up leaving his car mid conversation because he wasn't taking me seriously and we haven't really talked since. The following day I felt so liberated. I never felt so happy in my entire life. I realized that I deserved much better but the issue is, I never seem to give that to myself. Despite feeling pretty great about my crappy fling ending, I feel like a part of me is upset. I always end up grieving over people who didn't really try with me and for some reason I don't care this time. For some reason, I want him to see what he missed out on. I know he and I are on different wavelengths, I understand that. I just feel like he lost someone who could've given him real love and care, someone who would've fed his mind. He and I clicked, we had nothing in common but we clicked. He has never been involved with a girl like me, someone willing to feed his soul instead of his body. Sometimes he would make fun of me, call me a ""12 year old girl"" because my idea of a relationship doesn't include sex. I feel like nobody will date me because of this matter, though I know I'm beautiful and hold many admirable characteristics. I feel like this is all buzzing in my head and bringing me down. The fact that I am so underappreciated at times. I do it to myself. I wish I could stop. Thanks for reading this.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post describes the poster's experience with a toxic and unsatisfying relationship with their friend from high school. They mention feeling led on, having boundaries crossed, and feeling underappreciated. The post also discusses the poster's belief that their values and preferences in relationships, such as waiting until marriage for sexual activity, make it difficult for them to find someone who will date them. These experiences and feelings within relationships contribute to the mental disorders described in the post."

"Post: I saw this tumblr post going around the internet telling people to start the new year going to bed early and waking up refreshed, and I thought hell yes that sounds really nice, I should do that. Cause I'm superstitious and I always have this feeling at the back of my mind that however I start the year is going to be a premonition of how the rest of the year is going to be. For the past several years I've started the year either depressed, literally on the verge of suicide, or high as fuck, and the rest of the year always mirrored that, proving my paranoia right. So I said this year is going to be different. But it's 4:45am on jan 1st now and I'm drunk as hell because I ran out of weed so I couldn't sleep and now I'm suicidal as well and I can't help but feeling like 2018 is going to be a whole other year of drugs and booze and depression and it's like, what's the point? Why don't I just end it now? I just want to die lmfao I can't even bring in the new year right, I've screwed everything?? Fuck Where do I even go from here?

"Post: How can I open myself up more and not have therapy as this sort of gossip session? I want to say that I’m *feeling* suicidal again, but I just feel odd doing it. How can I make therapy worth more to my brain I suppose? What are good questions or things to say to really lead into that because my therapist thinks I’m getting better and am learning how to cope but in reality, I’ve become numb and emotionless. I also apologize for formatting, I’m on my phone.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling hesitant to open up in therapy and feeling uncomfortable discussing suicidal thoughts. This suggests that the poster may feel alienated, disconnected, or misunderstood in their therapy sessions.

"Post: being alive just seems so pointless. i feel as if i stay alive any longer, i’ll just continue to fuck things up and i will always end up a sad piece of shit. i didn’t ask for this. i didn’t ask to be born. i know i have a few people that love me but that doesn’t matter to me anymore. ending it all would be so nice. i wouldn’t have to deal with anything or anyone. i wouldn’t have any opportunities to mess up. i’m unsatisfied with everything in my life and it’s taking a toll on my entire being. i feel like a guilty fuck whenever i do ANYTHING. life is not enjoyable. none of this pain is worth it. why the fuck am i like this. i’m so ready to be gone. (i’m just venting, sorry if it just seems like a jumbled mess)  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of hopelessness and feeling disconnected from life. The poster mentions feeling unsatisfied with everything and feeling like they constantly mess things up.

"Post: Hi there, I'm here really just looking for some help, not for me specifically, but for a friend, or maybe help for me on how to help her. Warning, this is going to be kinda long. Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great. Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though. She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation. She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer. I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about. I wonder if any of you have been in similar situations, either mine or her's, and what kinds of steps you have taken.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions that the friend had been assaulted in high school, which is a clear indication of bias or abuse. The effects of this trauma are described, including difficulties with saying ""no"", self-hatred, shutting herself away, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal, and vivid nightmares. The post also mentions the friend's history of suicidal thoughts and previous attempts or plans for attempts. All of these factors suggest that the mental disorders experienced by the friend are a result of the bias or abuse she faced in the past."
"Post: I feel like I need to get out of the house, but I don't really like my options... They are: A) Go out to some bars etc. in my local college town and deal with drunk, belligerent college kids. B) Go to the nearest major city and fight insane traffic. C) Stay home, play video games, drink, just another night of the same shit... Don't feel like doing anything tbh, but I know sitting around dwelling on it will probably make me feel worse. I'm sure a lot of you are in a similar situation.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a sense of not liking the options for going out and feeling bored with the same routine. The poster also states that sitting around dwelling on their situation will likely make them feel worse.

"Post: Feeling pretty lonely, lately I have been having anxiety attacks and I’m pretty sure have officially slumped into depression. Didn’t think I would ever get depressed. It feels like nobody cares anymore. I wanted to be with my GF for New Year’s Eve, and she doesn’t want to. So now I’m just in the basement, wanting to cry and burst into tears but just doesn’t seem to want to happen. I feel so alone, I’ve tried to keep my mind clear by playing video games, but it doesn’t seem to work. I’m running out of options. I don’t know what to do. I just need somebody to hug me and tell me everything is going to be alright. I feel so helpless right now...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: and in ways that wouldn't hurt anyone if they found out. it's all very subtle, and the way i do it is mainly through poor self-hygiene. it might seem trivial, but it's pretty effective. i currently haven't showered in 5 days, and i feel like garbage inside and out. if someone finds out it's been a while since my last shower, it's whatever. they won't suspect that it comes from a place of self-loathing, and i never let it get so bad that they worry. i will go without brushing my teeth, washing my face, showering, and changing my underwear for as long as possible without it being super noticeable or causing significant damage to my health. why care about my health? health problems can cost money, and money problems can easily become an issue for my family and not just me. and then of course, i can't have others noticing my poor health and worrying. i have never been suicidal, would never self-harm, but i make my body hate me in other ways. i don't know how to ask for help because i don't want to make anyone worry about me. does anyone experience something similar? any advice?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post does not suggest any specific job-related stress or dissatisfaction.

"Post: Anybody else? I'm an aspiring screenwriter and I write my best stuff when I'm in the dark places my depression takes me. I stopped seeing my therapist and stopped taking my medication (sertraline) because I'm scared I'll never get to go to that place again and my writing will suffer because of it. It's ruining my life but it's helping me make a better one for myself. It's the weirdest fucking thing. I guess I could be take my medication like a good little boy, give up on ambition and go work in retail like everybody else I know. But I'm stubborn. I need somebody to talk to.

Post: anyone else’s disassociative streak plunge down the gutter so hard that you’ve legitimately begun to seperate yourself from your own dilemmas to a point where nothing really fazes you anymore perhaps to shield yourself from the whirlpool of shitty feelings that would otherwise have the power to cripple you and it’s leading you down a path of casual detachedness where nothing means anything to you anymore and you have no hopes for the future and you’ve convinced yourself you’ll never be happy and that you’re content suffering in your own mind cage from which there is no escape and you no longer put much effort into things because it’s all moot anyway and having that dull realisation that if something bad comes you’d just lie down and accept your fate because after years of this unhealthy practiced predisposition you know can't be helped?

Now I am soul clutching depressed, got work tomorrow early as hell as usual, and just wondering if anyone else is out there.. I really feel alone, like really alone. I lost all my friends and theirs just this like empty ness that my happiness goes to never return. Wish I had friends, someone to talk to, I have my girlfriend but it’s different and I don’t like her knowing I’m this depressed.

"Post: I'm not really sure if this is the place to post this, but it shouldn't really matter as it truly upsets me anyways. Honestly, I've got to be one of the unluckiest people ever. It's coming to be really stupid and upsetting how unlucky I am. My dad always told me in order for you to be happy, you must be positive. You need to do good things for other people. You need to be a good person. So, I decided to change who I am. Over the course of the last three years I've donated to several charities, I've helped in food drives, and much more. When I went to Africa a few years ago, I gave away several supplies and food to less fortunate families living on the beach. Every year, on holidays, if I'm doing something such as getting my haircut, I'll give them a pretty generous tip. (~$20 tip on a $14 haircut) I used to run a depression help and therapy sessions for people who wanted to end their lives. I've met amazing people and helped many people get past their biggest fears/ problems. Don't get me wrong or anything, I'm very thankful for those experiences and friends I've made. But really, the last three years of my life have also been the worst time of my life. I lost my first true love. A five year LDR, and we'd finally met in the fourth year. But ya know, of course, she ended up cheating on me with her best guy friend, that I told her I was worried about losing her to. ?\_(ツ)_/? FML. I just started college this year, got very close to my roommates. Felt very fortunate for the new friends I had made. Halfway through the year, we realized that one of our roommates had been stealing our shatter (for dabbing. thc concentrate). Which has account for more than $300 total. He also stole my friends juul (an e-cig), he won't admit to it and of course wouldn't buy him a new one and/ or give it back. The other roommate is very stingy with money, so of course, the generous person I am, I bought him a new one. Mind you I already bought him new juul pods (juice refills) a week prior, because I felt like I wanted to contribute and help him pay for it, since I've used it a few times before. This winter break my roommate, the one who owned the juul, let me take it home with me. Of course, at the end of the trip, flying home, I stuck it in my front right pocket and somehow it ended up gone. I always check the seat pocket in front of me and my seat after flying. So, yeah, I'm going to buy him another one. Realistically, the money isn't that big of a deal. I mean, I am a college student and my bank account is going down, down, down. However, it's really starting to get to me with all this negative-luck. Honestly, in the past i've wanted to kill myself, and with my luck, I wouldn't doubt I'd accidentally kill myself. I don't know how to get this shit to stop, but it's really starting to get to me. I don't understand how I can be a pretty good person, and be so goddamn unlucky; while people like my sister, who are complete assholes, do nothing but strive. ??????  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions several instances of negative experiences in relationships, such as the poster's long-distance relationship ending in cheating and their roommate stealing from them. These experiences have had a significant impact on the poster's mental well-being, as they mention feeling unlucky and have had thoughts of suicide in the past.

"Post: So yesterday, I asked all of my friends if they had plans for the New Years Eve as I had nothing to do. They all told me that they were not going to do anything and just gonna chill out with their family. So I thought, alright since all my friends aren't going out then I might as well just stay home with my family too. Shortly after the midnight countdown, I checked my snapchat, and what did I see? All my friends were partying it up and having fun without me! I was so fucking pissed off and sad. This wasn't the first time they did this and this was the last fucking straw, I am never gonna talk to them ever again.

"Post: I've recently had a bad break up. I was dating a really great girl but she dumped me. We were really close friends after we broke up and even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything because she didnt want to get back together with me. Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle and into some ambiguous territory where she can talk to me from time to time (Nowhere as frequent as before) about random shit, none of it personal and deep like it used to be. She doesnt trust me anymore. I know Im supposed to move on from my ex after Im dumped, especially if Im still in love with her, but I dont have any close friends and my ex was my best friend when we dated too. I tried to go on without her for a while when she ghosted me, but I was in the darkest place I had ever been in, I literally was so close to attempting, since then I've reached back out to her and I've reached a state where unlike before, I can live life, but I have a very strong urge I will never be happy because she will never be with me again. So we've been talking again for a day or two, a month ago, if she was active she would literally be texting me, she would tell me anything and everything, and that brought so much joy to my life. But now she'll talk to me about some random shit every few hours, seening my all the time like she doesnt really wanna let me in. But honestly, its better this way for my mental health than not talking to her at all. She often expresses how ""I still mean a lot to her"". I know through some sources that shes started to click with some other guy like we used when we first started dating and Im honestly so close to a fucking mental break down. Just the idea of her moving on already is like a fucking dagger through the heart, but if I stop talking to this girl I lose myself entirely right now. I dont know what to do, one of my friends died last night and that has put me in an even worse place than before. I would usually talk to my ex about it but shes pointed out (and its true) that I had a phase where I would go to her and seek attention and support and shes tired of it. I know shes right because it was an extremely narcissistic phase and It was definitely my bad. Anyway, I dont really know what to do, I havent cried in a few days but I think I will today.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the aftermath of a bad break-up and the poster's ongoing relationship with their ex.

The poster also expresses a deep longing for their ex and a fear of never finding happiness without them. Additionally, they mention the recent death of a friend, which has further affected their mental state. Overall, the post suggests that the mental disorders experienced by the poster are primarily caused by the relationship issues they are facing, including the break-up, the loss of their closest friend, and the feeling of not being able to fully connect with their ex."
Post: I'm a complete mess up. I can't even communicate properly to anyone. Not to family. Not to friends.

Additionally, they mention feeling scared, which may be a result of the distress caused by these relationship issues. Hence, the assigned label is Relationship."
"Post: *wave* I'm unsure where to even begin.. It's almost 2017. I'm 22 years old. I wake up every morning and regret the first and last breath of every moment from then until sleep carries me away, back into a dream world where my problems don't exist.. I'm struggling with things.. My memories just feel like I'm looking at a glimpse of somebody elses past.. I can't even focus on time accurately anymore. Everything seems to blend into one at times to the point that it's hard to recall whether things happened one day or another.. I have no purpose, no meaning in life, outside of living for my family. That's the one saving grace, I'd be long gone if they weren't around. But.. the longer this goes on the more I question the futility of living this way.. Selfish springs to mind, I would rip through their lives and leave an unfillable hole if I ever managed to muster the courage and end it all. On top of this mental nightmare, I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. I've managed to be trapped in a life where work is the only social activity I partake in.. I play video games occasionally, but always alone. Socially, I'm inert. I can't help but feel if I had more friends and some semblance of a social life, my problems would be alleviated slightly.. but I've tried to no avail. I struggle with making friends, more-so any good ones. I can only reminisce of the times before I pushed them all away it would seem. I feel the longer I stay here the further I drift ever closer to the end.. Looking for a job to no avail, the added failure stacking more onto an already miserable existence. Don't get me wrong, suicide clearly isn't the ideal situation. Even I understand that there are bound to be things in life I enjoy, love even, that I've never even experienced.. but one person can only take so much before they snap. Even if it's in the pursuit of happiness. People outside of this debilitating illness don't understand. I'm not sure many of them ever will. If I was asked ""Do you want to die?"" It's an easy no. Well why then? Because I'm tired of the crying, I'm tired of spending days in bed forcing myself to eat to avoid ending up back in the hospital.. There are no words that accurately definitively say what I feel, none that would provide the insight so many need to understand this shit. I'm at a point sometimes where I want to end it just to illustrate how I actually feel.. So people will finally understand.. Actions speak louder than words after all. Time will tell where I end up. As I write this, seeing my life outlined like this, I can't work out if I feel validated or like I've just sunk even further into the abyss.. I didn't anticipate writing so much, it wrote itself mostly.. Sorry if it bore any of you, I needed to speak and this is one of the few subreddits where I didn't think I would be judged. Thanks for reading.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a lack of purpose and meaning in life, feelings of isolation and loneliness, and a difficult relationship with their boss. The poster also mentions struggling to make friends and feeling like they have pushed people away in the past. These factors suggest that relationship issues, such as a lack of social connections and a negative work environment, are contributing to the mental disorders expressed in the post."
"Post: Every idea I've had since I turned 15 has either been something I've already come up with or something done already. Why can't I be as creative as I was when I was younger? Some of my ideas were stupid, sure, but they were still *interesting*. Nowadays tho I find myself drawing the same thing over and over and it's pretty monotonous--but I just can't draw anything else. Whenever I try I end up either hating it or changing it back to the same thing and it sucks.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of frustration and disappointment regarding their lack of creativity compared to when they were younger. They mention feeling stuck and unable to come up with new ideas, resulting in a monotonous and unsatisfying creative process. This suggests a feeling of alienation from their previous creative abilities and a sense of disconnection from their own creativity. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is likely related to the poster's feelings of alienation."
"Post: I loved you at the beginning 2017. You took me for a hell of a ride. I began to hate you more and more as each month went on. You brought to me so much sadness and suffering, at times I just wanted it to end. As much as this year took a turn for the worse I want to thank you. Thank you for the hardships you threw at me. 2017 made me stronger and wanting to anticipate 2018. I can happily say that I am no longer depressed. Just more eager to see what’s to come. Here’s to another year on this planet ????.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing sadness and suffering throughout the year and feeling depressed. However, in the end, the poster states that they are no longer depressed and are eager to see what the next year brings. This suggests that the mental disorders they experienced were not caused by bias or abuse, jobs and career, medication, or a relationship. Instead, the tone of the post indicates a sense of isolation and disconnection from others, as they mention being on this planet for another year. This suggests a feeling of alienation, which could have contributed to their previous depressive state."
"Post: I know it is probably stupid to ask this, but I feel like there is no use going out anywhere without anyone to enjoy it with. Is there anything I can enjoy doing alone? I am always stuck in my room all day and I hate it so much. I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I don't want my 20s to go by and have nothing to talk about. What's even worse about staying in my room for long periods of time is that I'm stuck with my thoughts. No matter what I do on the internet to distract me, there will always be something that triggers my sad thoughts .. and then make me cry for 15 minutes straight. I would like to go one day.. just one day of productiveness and no crying. Thank you so much for reading.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling unhappy and stuck in their room all day, with a desire to go out and enjoy activities with others. They express a sense of loneliness and a longing for companionship, as well as a negative thought pattern and frequent crying episodes. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their relationship issues and feelings of isolation."
"Post: EDIT: I was in a bad mood, mostly frustrated as the songs I made in the period of 2 weeks I was created hadn't struck a chord with me, but since the responses i've gotten i've since got a new perspective on it. To anyone who creates music, just know your stuff isn't shit. the effort you put into it is really something of its own amazing, and not everyone is gonna like your stuff.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling frustrated and in a bad mood due to the songs they created not meeting their own expectations. This suggests a connection between their mood and their job or career as a musician. However, since the post has been edited to express a new perspective and appreciation for their efforts, it is clear that the cause of the mental disorder is not ongoing job-related stress but a temporary setback in their creative work. Therefore, the assigned label would be None."
"Post: My pipes have either frozen or the water shut off during the night. It's 19 degrees inside my house as well as outside. My car busted a line before Christmas. Nothing but bad luck and bad news this year and I'm sick of it. To top it all off, I have no money and no food in the house. I just need a fairy godmother or a winning lottery ticket, or SOMETHING. I'm hurting.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions a series of unfortunate events, including frozen pipes, car troubles, bad luck, and financial hardship. These events can lead to high levels of stress and anxiety, especially if the individual is facing job instability or unemployment. The lack of money and food in the house also suggests financial strain, which can contribute to mental disorders. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to jobs and career."
"Post: So here I am again, at another new years celebration time after 2017 flew by. I just can't do this life thing anymore, its so stupid and pointless, I just don't care anymore, I wouldn't be losing much being dead. I have nothing to live for, and I am a loser. Im sick and tired of this life, and I just want to move on. I am due to turn 21 now, and you know what, TO HELL WITH THAT! Id like to die now, as a young person. I don't want to live into the future, I don't want to grow old, the way I see it, things are all getting progressively worse, and I feel like the future will be miserable. There is no point in continuing anymore. I don't like myself, I don't like what I see in the mirror, I don't like the time I was born into, I don't like my situation, I don't like my own personality, Everything about myself and my life I HATE THIS WORLD, I don't want to continue to be a part of it. It is extremely unfair, and horrifically materialistic. There just isn't any point, Its over. So maybe i'll get out my old power saw and slash myself open. Thats how I should die. The death of a person filled with self hatred, should die in the most brutal way possible.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests a deep sense of alienation and disconnection from the world, with the poster expressing feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and self-hatred. They express a desire to die and describe the future as miserable and pointless. They also mention feeling disconnected from society and hating the world and themselves. This sense of alienation and despair is likely a significant contributing factor to their mental disorders."
"Post: Got married at 25 to my ex (then 23) after four years of dating back in 2014. She called it quits by March 2015 after less than a year of marriage. She moved out in April 2015, and I've had very little contact since last Summer. She finally got around to having us exchange divorce paperwork a few months back, and on Jan 12 we'll be having a quick trial for a no-fault divorce. This was never a separation I wanted. I went from marriage counseling directly to weekly individual therapy last year, though I had found it unhelpful and stopped going after a few months. I feel like I annoy my friends when I try to talk to them about this, and there's always stuff going on in the back of my mind about this. I just want out of this mess, but I know in two weeks that even though there may be some legal closure, emotionally I'm not optimistic that things will be final. As a 28 year old guy, I hate that so much time has past and I still feel stuck and like shit. How do I get through this?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's failed marriage and ongoing emotional distress related to the divorce. They mention seeking marriage counseling and individual therapy, indicating that they are actively seeking help for their relationship-related struggles. The post also expresses a sense of feeling stuck and frustrated about the situation, suggesting that the cause of their mental disorders is rooted in their relationship issues and the associated emotions of loss and disappointment."
"Post: I'm stuck. At 18 years old I realize this empty feeling is all I know. I have no recollection of a childhood. No memory of a day before I just feel numb all of the time. To me a world outside of this mental state doesn't exist. It is misery; its also my comfort. I try to escape the grasp of my vices, everything and everyone that's made me this way. Every step I make on the up is just ten to plummet. There's no leaving my own sick head. That's why is easier to remain numb than to feel anything at all. Sorry for the thought garbage and thanks for reading.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post describes a persistent feeling of emptiness and numbness, as well as a lack of memory of childhood. These symptoms are indicative of a potential mental disorder, such as depression or dissociative disorder. However, the post does not provide any specific information that suggests a particular cause for these mental disorders. Therefore, the assigned label is ""None"" as the post does not provide enough information to determine the cause."
"Post: I live with my two cousins (sisters A &amp; B). One cousin I'm cool with, A. I used to live with her and just moved out due to me needing a closer house to my job so now I live with B. I've been struggling with depression most of my life but I hadn't really accepted it. To me I was raised that being depressed or bipolar or whatever is just an excuse and that I should just be normal. I have a habit of just eating everything so B confronts me about it when we go to Wal-Mart. Makes a huge lecture in the car about how ""I'm eating everything and what is wrong with me"". She's not lying so I just start thinking, *is this really how my life is going?* On the drive home, I was quiet and A took notice but dismissed it. This was two days ago. Earlier at A's house, A and I were in the kitchen and I started talking about how I felt. B was at work. Then the conversation went to me talking about what made me sad. How I feel like I suck the joy out of others. And how I saw a video about how one guy wanted to end it, so he's basically just eating himself to death. I told her that I feel like maybe I'm doing that too.... Eating to fill a void.... I told her how I miss my family (I moved out of my dads house and he's on the other side of the country so I can't just go down the street) and how I just am generally sad, dropping out of college, etc. How eating makes me forget how I feel and I feel at peace. How I'm too scared to actually do anything so I feel like I might just be letting nature take its course. Her face scared me. I never have told anyone about how I felt, except for y'all. (I post sometimes.) Her face just looked like I had told her I murdered puppies or something. Part of me hated that I told her, that I was weak. But another part, and the reason I post this, feels free. I feel good that someone knows. I don't feel alone. She's gonna help me lose weight and focus on music to try to find something meaningful in life. I feel good. I accept that I do suffer from depression. I was diagnosed before but as I said I didn't take it seriously. If you are reading this, I hope you find help and someone to trust. You aren't alone. There are more of us than you know.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's struggle with depression throughout their life, as well as their family's attitude towards mental health. They mention feeling that being depressed or bipolar is seen as an excuse and that they should just be normal. This indicates a potential bias or lack of understanding surrounding mental health within their family. 

The post also discusses the poster's habit of overeating and how it is confronted by their cousin B. This may be a coping mechanism for dealing with their emotions and filling a void, suggesting a potential relationship between their depression and their eating habits. 

Additionally, the poster mentions feeling scared and not trusting anyone with their feelings until they opened up to their cousin A. This indicates a potential need for medication to help manage their depression symptoms and to provide support and stabilization. Therefore, medication is the assigned label for this post."
Post: Can anyone post success stories about them or their friends getting out of depression and did well for themselves?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior. The poster is simply looking for success stories related to overcoming depression and achieving personal success, without providing any specific context or underlying cause for their depression."
"Post: After I decided it's happening, I felt a calm close to euphoria. Went through my day, got everything ready, it was so calm in my mind, Wondering if anyone else did.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling calm and euphoric after making a decision, which suggests that the poster may have a different perspective or experience compared to others. They also mention wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, indicating a sense of isolation or alienation from those around them. This feeling of being different or disconnected may contribute to the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
"Post: Hello there. First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker. I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald). Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not. I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better. People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks. I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself. I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her. So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much. I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect. So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much. **EDIT** Added metric units  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling unhappy with the poster's body, voice, and appearance, which suggests a potential history of bias or abuse related to body image. The poster also mentions feeling poor and having a fear of rejection due to their appearance, indicating that these experiences may be contributing to their depression. Additionally, the post mentions a lack of self-acceptance and a belief that they are not attractive to others, which further suggests that bias or abuse related to appearance is a contributing factor to their mental disorders."
"Post: Two years and some change ago, I left the Marines to attend college and move my life forward. Even before separating, I had severe depression and anxiety issues that helped me make the decision to leave. Soon after I separated and began my coursework, my depression exploded to the point where I couldn't do anything and my anxiety to the point where I was terrified of leaving the house. I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because ""it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful"" or because I was terrified of being around people. I tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually. She had no answer when I brought up the 22 movement, which infuriated me even more and showed me that I wasn't going to get help there. Next I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA. So I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state). Adding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August. Since then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description. The worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left. I have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless. And that kills me because I have a dog that I don't think I can live without (the only creature left that I feel truly gives a damn about me)  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post describes a series of events and circumstances that have contributed to the poster's mental health issues. They mention leaving the Marines and experiencing depression and anxiety before and after separating from the service. They also discuss their unsuccessful attempts at therapy, their deteriorating relationship with their wife, and their difficulties finding employment. These experiences have led to a sense of isolation and disconnection from others, indicated by the mention of losing friends and feeling alone during the holidays. Therefore, it can be concluded that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to a sense of alienation."
"Post: I'm making this post just to vent mainly. Here's some stuff about me: I am a mid 20s male. I make good money, enough to save half of it and probably retire early. I have a great girlfriend that is an absolute blessing in my life. I'm decently in shape and used to be a bodybuilder but that kind of slipped away. I'm a smart person, always in the top 15% of whatever academic class. Great parents that support me. It all started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed. Later I learned that most people get depressed in grad school because it's such a shitty prospect. It has been 1.5 years since I decided to dropout from a PhD and I'm still fucking livid about how shitty it was. Like I can't move my life past it. Now my job is mostly boring and easy but pays way better. Now here I am 2 years later and still depressed. It's just like I am watching my life fall apart in front of my very eyes unable to do anything about it. But that's the thing, I have it so good that I can't even let my life fall apart. One person told me I couldn't fail if I tried and it's like I'm trying to prove him wrong. It's like I'm trying to fail but I just can't. And I think that contributes to the helpless feeling. At the heart of my depression is just the hopelessness and lack of control that kills me. I want to feel like I'm in some sort of control over my life but it feels like no matter what I do, hard work, lazy, focus on this or that, it just feels like it doesn't matter either way. That takes all of the fun out of life for me. It feels like life turned from a choose-your-own-adventure to a roller coaster ride with a fixed track. No way to get off the ride, just have to take the shit that comes along. I'm slowly giving up all the passions I used to have because I'm either not good enough or I'm worse at stuff than I used to be. I long to be like the 21 year old version of myself. I was so happy then. But I'm so confused because right now I live with a guy who is fat, eats unhealthy, doesn't have many friends, is annoying, no college degree, never moved out of this area. Just generally a nerd with little social skills. But he seems to be happy. And I'm so confused. How can I have so much more going for me but be miserable? I just want this to end. I want to just be satisfied and happy with my life but I can't find anything that will scratch that itch. I'm just existing and the only thing I'm looking forward to is getting a dog, retiring early, and getting married. Those are pretty cool things, but it just feels like brain is so fucked that I won't be able to enjoy it. I smoke weed (not all the time) to cope and it helps, but really just delays these feelings like I'm having now. Fuck.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's experience in grad school and their decision to drop out, which they describe as a negative and depressing experience. They also mention that their current job, although easy and well-paid, is boring and contributes to their feelings of depression. The post highlights a sense of hopelessness, lack of control, and the belief that hard work and effort do not matter. These sentiments are common in individuals experiencing job-related stress and dissatisfaction, suggesting that the mental disorder in this post is caused by the poster's jobs and career situation."
"Post: Was with some friends, feeling really really depressed as usual at this point, and I left as soon as the ball drops. Get home and tell her im scared of another year with depression. She told me that I put too much pressure on her. She then says she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now. I like her so much. I tried to overdose on my zoloft but my mom stopped me. She won't take me to the hospital. I just turned 17 and this is the third year I've been dealing with depression. I want to hug somebody I'm so sad  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and having a desire for a romantic relationship. The poster describes their disappointment and sadness after a conversation with someone they like who tells them they don't want to be in a relationship. They also mention a suicide attempt with medication and a lack of support from their mother. It is clear that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's relationships, including their desire for a romantic partner and their feelings of rejection and lack of support."
"Post: I have suffered from depression my entire life. About a year ago it was at its worst. I went to a mental hospital, got an appropriate diagnosis and medicine. It was the best thing I ever did, but why am I still suffering a year later. Things I did right: Got sober (11 months) Gave up pot (only 2 days) Going to AA daily. Going to therapy weekly. Taking meds. Sleeping every night. eating better (like every day) Went low-contact with narcissistic mother (moved out of her house) Got a REALLY good new job. Got a physical, getting blood work back soon, she thinks I am low in B12 and D Broke up with boyfriend. Things I am struggling with: Still very low energy. not working out. not cooking, not eating that well, but better. not drinking water. hopeless. I beat myself up daily. Is this as good as it gets. My psychiatrist seems happy that I am doing so much better than I was, but really, is this as good as it gets? I am glad I have removed the toxic people (mother, bf) and a bad job, from my life. But I haven't refilled it with new people. I am meeting new people at AA. I am uncovering a lot of abuse I suffered, but was unaware of. Turning up a lot of sadness. It's hard connecting with others. I wish I had hope. I feel like I will die alone. Any thoughts?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that the poster has been diagnosed with depression and has been taking medication for it. Despite making positive changes in their life, such as getting sober, going to therapy, and getting a new job, the poster still expresses ongoing struggles with low energy, self-esteem issues, and a feeling of hopelessness. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is connected to a combination of the person's underlying depression and the ongoing challenges they face, even with the use of medication."
"Post: I should be happy. I have a job and a man who loves me and I live in a beautiful place because of him. I feel bad for feeling bad. All the shit in my life, the pain, the abuse, the rape...I don't even know if that's what hurts or if it's just the existential dread that I am nothing and am useless. I don't know if finishing grad school will even make me happy, because how could I ever be happy? I keep searching for meaning or being able to feel SOMETHING, literally anything but this blah-ness that encompasses everything I do. I drink, I go out, I go on rollar coasters, I run away for a month and nothing changes. Everything still feels like nothing. I'm empty. The only time I feel alive is when I'm playing video games because then I'm not me, I'm doing something totally abnormal. But my life is meaningless. There is not light, no happiness. I get brief glimpses of that feeling I don't even remember when my bf hugs me or shows he cares in some small way but overwhelmingly I'm just...empty. And it's isolating to feel like this. I feel so alone. He tries to understand but he doesn't live in my head, he can't know. I appreciate that he tries but I still feel overwhelmingly alone.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling empty, having a lack of meaning or purpose, and struggling with feelings of loneliness and isolation.

"Post: I want to be succesful but I'm currently struggling with depression/anxiety. I'm 18 and I'm really lost at life, almost dropping out of high school due to the complete utter unmotivation to study whatever comes.

"Post: They say I have low self-esteem. I say: I have a realistic view of myself and my abilities. It's not about comparing myself to other people. There is always going to be someone better. SomeONES. I'm probably not even average on most of the metrics that matter. It's just... this is who I was ten years ago, and it's going to be who I am twenty years from now. I'm slowly coming to terms with that fact, but it leaves a major question: if this is me, and I'm not worth very much at all, then what justification is there to keep on grinding on, day after day, just to pay some other fucker's mortgage on their third home?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests a sense of alienation and disconnect from others. The poster expresses low self-esteem and a realistic view of themselves, believing that they are not worth much and will not improve in the future.

"Post: Mindless Self Indulgence - It Gets Worst comes to mind immediately. This song is pretty much my theme song. I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot. Behemoth, Shade Empire, Dimmu Borgir, Hate. Great bands. Since I am usually not happy, I rather sit and listen to music that is about death, destruction, hatred, pain, misanthorpy, war, and satanism. All the dark shit. I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace. It fits in with usually how I feel. If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless. Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place. I should have my vocal cords removed. I thought I would be happier because I got a better job, but being lonely really sucks a lot more than I thought it would.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a sense of not fitting in and being different from others, as well as a preference for dark and negative music that reflects their own feelings. The poster expresses a dislike for social interaction and a belief that making new friends or finding a romantic partner is pointless. They also mention feeling lonely despite having a better job, suggesting a sense of disconnection and alienation from others. Therefore, it can be inferred that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to a sense of alienation and social isolation."

Everyday wanting it to be over finally. I hope you keep fighting though. I hope you keep trying to live And Not living only because you dont want your death to hurt people but truly living because you want to be alive.

"Post: Hi, does anyone else cope pretty well during the day (by keeping busy, staying relatively productive thus numbing out your emotions) and then completely fall apart at night? I've been doing pretty okay during the day, but at night I am almost always suicidal. Yesterday, I cried from 7PM to 1AM and it was completely exhausting. It took everything out of me and I just wanted to end it all. But then, by the morning, I am almost completely fine? Like i don't even feel depressed or suicidal at all... and then I invalidate my depression and I question if I do really have it or not? But then the cycle continues... suicidal at night, okay during the day, questioning/invalidating my depression and then suicidal at night again. Other times I just feel completely numb and dissociated and as if I'm floating and living in limbo and just existing but not actually living. Does anyone experience this? How do you deal with it?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post describes a pattern of feeling fine during the day but experiencing intense suicidal thoughts and emotions at night. The poster also mentions questioning and invalidating their depression, which suggests a sense of detachment or disconnection from their own emotions and experiences. This pattern of feeling isolated and disconnected from their own feelings, as well as the intense emotional distress at night, indicates a possible sense of alienation as the cause of the mental disorders in this post."
"Post: Just want to know anybody here that use antidepressant and also whey protein powder. I read on forms that they don't go so well together. Not sure if it is a placebo effect. I been trying to workout with a friend, but my motivation is at a all time low. Don't exactly know what to do. I am also very paranoid about using supplements since I think they can counter the effects of antidepressants Please help, thanks.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

Post: My therapist is thinking about terminating me seeing her due to the fact that im not making any progress. What the fuck am I supposed to do afterwards? Suffer with mental illness? Get medication and hope it helps? Go to a physiologist? Im confused and scared and I just want to get better.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the possibility of the therapist terminating the therapeutic relationship due to lack of progress. This suggests that the poster is experiencing difficulties in their mental health and seeking help from a professional. The post also mentions feeling confused, scared, and wanting to get better.

"Post: I used to have goals. I wanted to be somebody that my parents would be proud of. I used to believe that I was destined for bigger things. Reality hit me. I’m not special, the world doesn’t revolve around me. I exist but my existence is not as meaningful as I thought. I realized so many things about myself this last year. I’m not as smart as I thought I was. I’m not important to anybody. I have nothing to offer to the world. It’s just a hard realization I came to. I was never meant to do anything but work a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck. I set a date for when I’m going to die. It’s the only thing I feel like I have control over, but even then I don’t know if I can hold on for a few more years. I’m struggling to find anything that will give me purpose to be here. I’m alive but every day is the same and all I want is purpose. Just any reason to keep going. The world is beautiful and there are so many reasons to not give up, but I can’t find any right now. I wish somebody would notice that I’m not ok. I don’t know what I’m holding on to right now.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling unimportant, lacking purpose, and having a realization about themselves and their future. They express feelings of being destined for a dead-end job and living a paycheck-to-paycheck life. These feelings suggest a dissatisfaction and lack of fulfillment in their current job or career path, which can contribute to mental disorders such as depression and feelings of hopelessness. The post also mentions setting a date for when they want to die, indicating severe distress and despair related to their job and career situation. Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to jobs and career."
"Post: What I mean by this, is that they care to hear how you're doing and stuff, and they do care of your existence. For example, if you fall ill, they may say something like ""Well, I hope ____ feels better soon!"" That kind of thing. But a lot of people don't care about you, they care *of* you. If they aren't the kind of person who talks and listens to you, then I feel like that means they only care of you. I have a bunch of family members who I only talk to when I see them, like on holidays. Those people, unfortunately, don't care about me. They care of me. I feel like there's a difference. I don't know if know if these are warbled depression thoughts, or if I'm just realizing this, but it seems to be the case. I know telling people about depression is usually overwhelming, but I can't help but feel so brushed off. I hate when I tell people stuff like ""I'm not feeling too well lately, and my life has gotten pretty rough,"" and they'll simply dismiss it with an ""Oh, okay."" I can't help but feel so tiny and insignificant when this happens. Maybe I'm not being rational, but I feel like most people I know honestly don't care about me, but rather, again, of me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's perception of other people's lack of genuine care and concern for them. They specifically mention family members who only interact with them on holidays and dismissive reactions from people when they share their struggles. This indicates a sense of loneliness, feelings of being brushed off, and a desire for deeper connections and support from others. These relationship-related issues are likely contributing to the mental disorders experienced by the poster."
"Post: I know I posted this a few days ago... but I'm fucking TIRED. I'm tired of going to therapy and being on medication and having this stupid hopeful mindset of ""wow I'm actually getting better"" only to have my mentally ill, destructive brain destroy me. I've never been suicidal... but I just want to not exist. I look like I have my shit together to the outside but on the inside, my awful, scary demons chew me up and spit out like a piece of gum... Fuck depression. Fuck anxiety. Fuck relapse. Fuck my mother for making me this way. I can only swim up from rock bottom so many times before I want to just let myself sink and stay there. I am so hopeless. I am pathetic. I am a waste of space. I will never be happy. I will never get through this. My demons are speaking right now. This isn't me. Is it?? Am I just fucking doomed? Who the hell would want to be with someone like me anyway? I come off as beautiful and magical but really I've got more baggage than I can carry-- baggage I don't expect anyone to want to help me with... Idk. This post is stupid. Just... I'm struggling so bad after having a good day and I don't know why I keep relapsing when I've been on such a good track for six months...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of hopelessness, self-doubt, and a negative self-perception.

"Post: Normally i feel threatened by ''good-looking'' people and such. But when they show weakness or some traits that i deem not good, weak whatever, i get a feeling of disdain for that person.

Reasoning: The post mentions feeling threatened by ""good-looking"" people and having a disdain for those who show weakness or traits that the poster deems as not good or weak. This suggests a bias or negative attitude towards certain individuals based on their appearance or perceived weaknesses.

"Post: I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company. I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period. I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it. Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort. When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours. I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain. I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then. Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's recent move, their job performance, and pressure at work. They also mention feeling reluctant to go to work and feeling like everyday routines are becoming difficult.

"Post: You don't understand why I stopped being a lawyer and became a writer. You don't understand why I want to move abroad and left the city I always wanted to live in. You don't understand any of my choices. I understand you. You want me to be safe. What you don't know I'm fighting depression and suicidal thoughts. I need to be happy. I know I should already know how to be happy being 30 years old, but I don't. Some days I even don't know who I am. Who I really am. I am only surviving. I wish you could understand how I am feeling.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling misunderstood by others and struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. They express a deep desire to find happiness and a sense of identity. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their relationships with others, particularly their feeling of being misunderstood and unsupported by those around them."
"Post: Good luck to all of you as you continue with your battle of depression and anxiety. I've come to the realization that, while I tried to help others with my previous posts, I'm only bringing myself down. I'm on a journey of self-love, and unfortunately, that means leaving quite a few things in the past, including this subreddit. Thank you for your time, and I wish you all my love. Username checks out.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior.

"Post: I thought this girl would probably be the one, as crazy as it sounds, but when she told me she moved on my world came crashing down. I haven't been able to get my mind off of her.

Reasoning: The post mentions a romantic relationship that has ended and the poster's heartbreak and inability to move on. They express a strong emotional attachment and difficulty in getting their mind off of the person.

"Post: This game hurts. Thinking of the game as a whole. I long for the friendship that Max and Cloe had. I never had any close friends, they were never caring and we lost ways. I spent my entire life alone, I wish I could have had a meaningful lasting friendship. I want to live in the gorgeous small town close by the beach and forest. I'm stranded here in the desert with plenty of dead trees, dirt, noise, bumper-to-bumper traffic and obnoxious sociopaths.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses a longing for meaningful friendships and a sense of connection. The poster mentions never having close, caring friends and feeling alone their entire life. They also contrast their current environment, described as a desert with dead trees and obnoxious sociopaths, with their desired location, a small town near the beach and forest. This sense of being stranded and disconnected from their desired environment and lacking meaningful friendships indicates a feeling of alienation, which likely contributes to their mental disorders."
"Post: Hi, My parents love me, unconditionally, they want the best for me, they have sacrificed a lot for me to come to where I am now, I got a high score in my final exams and I want to become a politician, but my parents won't let me because of the ""sins"" that will be committed, I am religious, the reason I want to become a politician is because my native culture is DYING in my country, the my culture is part of the majority ethnic group, our ethnic group's culture is being wiped off, the government stopped teaching my country's history so children become less patriotic, the police are corrupted, and many more atrocities are committed by the government. It is my dream, but if I ditch my parents I would want to kill myself, I would not be able to hold in the guilt. My dad also believes that if the elders of the party order you to do something and you don't do it, because it is not moral or just plain stupid,they will kick you off the party, can't I just create my own party? This post may be a little stupid, but I need some advice. Thank you so much! :) PS: Yeah, I know politicians are crooks, especially in my country, but I am becoming one also because of this reason, too many crooks in my country's government. :P  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a conflict between the poster's desire to become a politician and their parents' opposition to it based on their religious beliefs. The poster explains that if they were to go against their parents' wishes, they would feel extreme guilt and even contemplate suicide. This suggests that there is a significant amount of bias or abuse within the family, potentially related to religious beliefs and cultural differences."
"Post: Ive never felt so alone. Everything I do pales in comparison to others, my life just feels stale and bland. Especially with relationships... 19 and never had anyone attracted to me! I feel like a loser. I am not really good at anything either, I practice but I just never see myself improving, sports, losing weight, drawing, being social-- They just don't work for me. So ive just given up on doing anything. It won't matter Nobody cares about me anyway, I just am alone. Last night I sat up and scrolled around on Facebook and saw all these people partying and these couples kissing and it just upset me for the whole day. Now I realize how much I don't really matter.

All of these factors indicate that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is likely related to a sense of alienation and disconnection from others."
"Post: I'm always tired but I can never sleep. When I finally do sleep, I can finally be at peace and then I wake up to this shitty feeling. When I was a kid, I used to joke around with my mom every time she tried dragging me out of bed, ""I wanna sleep forever."" She told me not to joke around about it but at the time I didn't understand the implications. But I mean it now. I never wanna wake up.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling tired and having difficulty sleeping, which can be symptoms of a mental disorder such as depression or anxiety. The mention of joking about wanting to sleep forever as a child and now sincerely feeling that way suggests a deep sense of hopelessness and disconnection from life.

"Post: A lot of the trouble I have is I've been down so bad for so long I don't even know what to do with myself and I start ruminating and feeling shitty.

"Post: I've found that if I keep my energy up, my other depressive symptoms will go away, if they're not too severe that day. My drug of choice is Red Bull. Coffee can do the same if it's strong enough. None of this Starbucks Frappachino bullshit. Those are delicious, but do as much as water. Has anyone else found similar results from raising energy levels?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions using Red Bull and strong coffee as a means to alleviate depressive symptoms by raising energy levels. This indicates a reliance on substances as a form of self-medication rather than seeking professional help or using prescribed medication. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is attributed to the use of medication (specifically caffeine) to manage depressive symptoms."
"Post: I went to the strip club for New Years Eve and a stripper asked if I was a virgin. She said I had a weird slur and started to call out all of my insecurities. I told her to go away, but, she wouldn't listen. I eventually picked her up and threw her across the table. Then I knocked one of the bouncers out. 5 more of them came, tackled, and beat me to shreds. I had to spend my New Years in jail. Today, I was let go on PR; however, I am going to be a convicted felon who's about to serve a few years. I do have a Autism Certified lawyer that could get me on Probation or Parapro Patrol. If my charge is a felony, I'm going to kill myself. The only sucessful felons are famous people like Ben Carson, Chris Brown and DMX  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing verbal abuse from the stripper, who called out the poster's insecurities. The poster also reacts violently by throwing the stripper and then assaulting a bouncer. They express distress over the potential consequences of their actions, including the possibility of becoming a convicted felon, and even express suicidal thoughts. This suggests that they may have been dealing with bias or abuse, as the verbal insults and mistreatment from the stripper could have contributed to their mental distress and led to their violent outburst."
"Post: Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend. We've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed. This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it. Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I ""was never there for her"" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more ""fucked up"" than she is and I don't even realize it. I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members. I just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she's in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions several instances of biased or abusive behavior within the friendship. The poster mentions feeling uncomfortable around their friend when she is under the influence of drugs, and feeling pressured to try drugs by the friend. The friend also blames the poster for her own struggles and attempts to manipulate the poster by sending a suicide note and stating that the poster is ""fucked up."" These behaviors indicate a pattern of bias or abuse within the friendship, which likely contributes to the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
"Post: When you need to get to sleep. When you can't keep yourself distracted much longer. Always when you have something to do the next day. Anyone else adequately distract themselves (most of the time).during the day, but can't avoid it at night?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a difficulty with sleep and an inability to distract themselves, specifically at night. This suggests a sense of alienation or disconnection from others, as the poster mentions feeling alone in their struggle to distract themselves during the day but being unable to avoid their racing thoughts and difficulty sleeping at night.

The only things I can do is play games, D&amp;D (not as good as my siblings, might I add), and debate religion/ethics, all three of which are taken up completely on youtube so I wouldn't even get seen by anyone, and both were hit by adpocalypse so even if I were to get popular I would be demonetized instantly.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's lack of proficiency in technical skills like building computers and coding, while also expressing frustration with their limited abilities in hobbies like playing games and participating in online debates. This suggests that the poster may be experiencing feelings of inadequacy and frustration in their chosen career path or lack thereof. The mention of adpocalypse and monetization issues on YouTube further reinforces the connection between their career struggles and their mental state."

"Post: Every time I type something up here I think of all the times I've been psychologically tortured by ""friends"" and just people online to the point of it being more harmful than my own mental illnesses that I get scared. Tonight I'm not scared. It's been tough since November. TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism? I thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital. I don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening. I don't know what the hell I want out of posting here, I've just found myself at this sub reddit more and more and I guess tonight I needed to get this off of my chest. Lord knows if I do it on FB someone will call the police again for a wellness check (despite knowing I 1) have a safety plan with my therapist I see weekly and 2) have been known IN THE PAST to get myself to the psych ER when I'm feeling low enough) or accuse me of drama or something else. I don't know. Fuck the holidays, fuck new years and I wish I had friends who cared. Everyone I've ever tried to meet online or in any of my games either turned out to be transphobic, homophobic and absolutely psychotic the second I refused their advances. I just want fucking conversation where someone's end game isn't to get laid (I'm asexual so good luck bruh) or treat me like a piece of shit.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, anorexia, and alcoholism. The poster also mentions feeling emotionally blunted and numb, as well as difficulty focusing on activities and feeling like a loser. They mention trying various therapy techniques (CBT, DBT, CPT) but not finding much relief.

"Post: 2017 was a shit show. I sat in my room alone last night and watched the ball drop. Today I woke up still depressed.

Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling alone and depressed, as well as watching the ball drop alone in their room.

This sense of alienation and loneliness is likely contributing to their mental disorder."
"Post: after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago). my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit. I'm afraid of freezing up and being incapable of speaking honestly. but knowing this is my anxiety speaking, it'll probably go well and be over before I know it... or it could seem to last an eternity and I'll feel trapped the whole time, as per usual. don't know why I've typed this. guess it would be nice to receive some advice, experiences, what to say, etc. not expecting replies though. gonna take a hot shower, then ponder about this until I fall asleep. goodnight. edit: wording.

"Post: I've been feeling worse than usual. I always feel down and depressed and feel like I have no purpose but since it is a new year, I decided I want to view things in a positive light. It's already the third day of the year and I'm having a breakdown. I really don't deserve to live. I've been eating like a pig, I am a disappointment to my family and no one cares about me. The only reason I still am holding on is because of my religion but then again I still want to end it all. I want to be better but I have no one to talk to or to help me. Today I told my mom how suicidal I feel and how I want to kill myself and she just laughed. Made me feel like shit. That's why I don't talk to anyone about how I feel. I guess I'll bottle it all up and let it explode sometimes in the near future. Maybe then I finally will get the guts to kill myself. For now I'll just keep bruising myself. I'm done with this all. Am I the only one? Will I always be alone? Why does it keep on getting worse? Why am I still alive? God, why did I have to exist if I'm such a disgusting person?

Reasoning: The post mentions feeling down, depressed, and without purpose, which suggests a general feeling of sadness and isolation. The poster also mentions feeling like a disappointment to their family and feeling that no one cares about them.

"Post: Too afraid to give people the label of a friend, despite the incredibly nice thing they do for me and too afraid to interact with others to boost my social skills in fear of them secretly hating me or knowing how weird I already am.

"Post: Hello, in need of some advise. I have a 2 year old greyhound who I have had for 1 year and I am thinking of giving him up. The reason for this is because of my lack of motivation due to my anxiety and depression. I never walk him because I can’t seem to make myself go out the house, I stay at home all day and it seems the only time I ever clean my house is when I have something to look forward which is another story but anyway due to not walking my dog he wees in my house and even poos sometimes, he is wrecking my house! He chews my carpets, eats anything in sight and I just can’t cope with him. I really do love him but he is ruining my life, I can’t even take him anyway because he destroys other people’s houses too. I think because he is a working dog he needs lots of walks to release his energy and because I don’t I think he is using that energy on ruining my house. I know I sound cruel but I really am depressed and I feel really bad for him:( I just need to know what would be the right thing to do, if I did get rid of him I would be very upset  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

"Post: I’m a positive guy, I make people laugh, and I have a supportive household, to anyone even on here that sounds like heaven. But ever since elementary school its been a same circle of talking to people, making them happy, and then them forgetting about me in the long run to the point of were I cant tell you who I can actually view as a friend or not. Same thing with girls that I seem to fall in “love” with too easily, I end up admitting my feeling to them and then I either get a “no” or “idk”, and its gotten to the point to were loving someone doesn’t even se m option anymore. Love from family is definitely a positive thing to have, but as humans we can thrive to have some form of compassion from a stranger, and as we continue to thrive it ends up going from a want, to a need, to something we’re just depressed not to have. I guess I’m looking for some form of an answer or resolution before I end up sinking a lot farther than I want into melancholy.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling forgotten and unsure about who the poster can truly consider a friend. They also mention difficulties in romantic relationships, including admitting their feelings to someone and receiving rejection or uncertainty in response.

"Post: Graduated from high school in '13 and everything went downhill. Lost a significant other of 2 years to a ""best friend"" who enjoyed sex with her, as well as a few other ""friends"" of hers. I was in ""love"" I guess but that spiraled into excessive drinking, partying, drugs, suicide attempts, and problems at home. I can't believe I'm still here today, but I lost a lot as things went down the pit. I had some true friends who I ended up abusing their kindness, and there's no chance of them coming back. On top of that, I made a fool of myself to my entire demographic in my hometown. It's a surprise I'm still here today, but at the same time I cannot help but to think of how much less pain I would be in if one of those attempts were successful. I'm not considering doing it right now, but I wonder when I'll burn the last of my rope. At this point there's nobody who can help me other than myself, but it's going to be a long and lonely road. Here's one for those who tried, and an apology to those who simply had enough. I love you all, but there's no reason to love me back. Take care, Tally Chiles HS Class of 2013.

Post: It's big day for me and I feel guilty for not being happy and not wanting to enjoy it but all I want to do is to shut myself off from everyone and sleep.

"Post: I posted about an hour ago in r/relationships about a situation with my roommate where he owes me $1000 in unpaid debt, and I told his mom about it when she came to visit. Most people sided with me, and told me I was right to do what I did. This was a great boost of confidence, and I finally felt certainty in my actions after all the apprehension I've felt while dealing with my roommate's failure to pay his bills. Tonight, I decided to tell my Mom, Dad, and sister about my decision, certain that they would finally side with me and praise me for doing the right thing, and being assertive. I know that in the past they have sympathized with my roommate, but I wanted them to see once and for all that I'm not the bad guy for wanting to take him to court, or to tell his parents about the massive debt that he owes me. Their reactions were...not good. My mom buried her face in her hand and said, ""You *really* shouldn't have done that."" My Dad fell silent, and didn't say anything. He had a look on his face that said, ""You fucked up"", though. I started rattling off stuff that people told me on Reddit about how right this decision was, and how I'm doing the right thing, about how great it was that I was finally taking action, etc. My sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations! Getting validation from strangers on the internet really makes you confident in yourself, huh?"" Why doesn't she see how right I am? This whole situation with my roommate is cut-and-dry, and I'm taking the necessary steps to fix it. I started reciting some of the answers I got (they were really well-written), but the more I spoke, the more angrier they got, until my sister's eyes bore into me like daggers, and my Mom was sort of just standing there laughing, in an exhausted kind of way. ""There's no going back now."" she said in a defeated tone of voice. ""What's done is done. You let random internet people tell you what to do instead of us, and you're going to feel the consequences of that decision very soon."" My voice cracked a little as I desperately tried to convince them to side with me, until Dad said, ""That's enough. We're not talking about this anymore. You're making your Mom upset."" Why can't my family just be proud of me? I'm clearly, *clearly* doing the right thing here, and yet my parents seem to be more concerned about preserving the peace with my deadbeat roommate than getting my money back. Their *son's* money! I'm the one they should feel sorry for, not him. A lot of people in that Reddit thread told me that I care way too much about what my family thinks, and I agree whole-heartedly. I don't know how to stop caring about what they think, because right now, they're all I've got. I don't really have any good friends who will talk to me about life situations without tuning out, or ignoring me. I've never dealt with difficult life situations like this before, and I need all the support I can get. I try to do all the right things, all the time, and I can't please them or make them happy. Nothing is ever good enough. I apologize if I sound dramatic, but these emotions have a firm hold on me and I can't make them stop. I want people to know how much my parent's disapproval means to me. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I might need some advice on how to stop caring what they think, because tonight, I felt like I *needed* them to tell me that I made the right decision, because I will be dealing with a pissed-off roommate for two months, and it would really help to have people in my corner to tell me that I'm not the bad person that my roommate is making me out to be.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's need for validation and approval from their family after making a decision regarding their roommate. They express disappointment and frustration when their family does not support their actions, highlighting a desire for their family's opinion to align with their own. The post also mentions a lack of good friends who are willing to provide support and advice, further emphasizing the importance of relationships in the poster's mental well-being. Overall, the issue of seeking validation and support from family and the impact of their disapproval on the poster's mental state suggests that relationships are the cause of their mental disorder."
"Post: Serious. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me to die. I am so completely absolutely fed up with living. I've no idea why I can't kill myself, please don't tell me it's because deep down I want to live, I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE. It's just I do not have the balls to override the thousands of years' of evolutionary biology that wants my genes to keep living. If I could get the balls to do it then I would, I'm just a coward I guess. Please please, tell me how can I kill myself, without pain (as I'm a coward). I'm in England so I have no gun. I haven't the balls to jump or hang myself. I think drugs is probably the best choice, but I'm scared of causing pain (as I said I am a coward), how can I do it peacefully, I've searched and search on the internet but every reply to every post is just more of the same; don't do it, your worth so much more etc. etc. I've heard it all before, please just help me die. Thank you.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses extreme despair and a strong desire to die. The poster describes feeling trapped by evolutionary biology and lacking the courage to overcome it. They also express frustration with receiving the same messages of worth and value from others, indicating a sense of alienation and disconnection from a support system. This overwhelming feeling of isolation and hopelessness suggests that alienation is the cause of the mental disorders in this post."
"Post: Hi all. This is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far). I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors related to relationships that contribute to the poster's mental disorders. They mention having severe cyber anxiety and fear of being attacked or mocked online, which suggests a fear of negative social interactions. The post also mentions social anxiety, depression, and a difficulty in making and maintaining friendships, which indicates a sense of loneliness and isolation. The poster shares their experience of losing close friends after going to college and experiencing depression, further highlighting the impact of relationship-related stress on their mental well-being. Additionally, they express a longing for someone's empathy and a need to feel connected and cared for, which suggests that their mental disorders are influenced by a lack of positive relationships and support."
"Post: It's been a few months since she broke up with me. She gave me hope when she left that she may be willing to try things again down the road. I've worked on myself and matured a lot since then. I really believe she would be happy with the changes. I recently reached out and she said she wasn't ready to see me yet. I still have some hope because it sounds like she could be ready to see me eventually. I'm going to give her more space. I'm willing to be patient because I love her so much. But that doesn't mean waiting is easy, especially since I don't have any certainty. I still miss her and think about her everyday. It hurts. I try to distract myself with a lot of different things, but my mind always comes back to her. I'm not really looking for advice. I just wanted to get things off my chest because things haven't been easy for me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses a recent breakup and the poster's ongoing feelings for their ex-partner. They mention hoping for a reconciliation and working on themselves to improve the relationship. The post also expresses feelings of pain, missing their ex-partner, and constantly thinking about them.

"Post: My depression feels like an overwhelming heavy-ness depleting the motivation, confidence and happiness of my former self. I know all of the ways to fight depression by eating, sleeping, drinking water, meditating well. But majority of the time I can't get myself to do any of those. Smoking pot gets my thoughts racing now on how I continue to fuck up. Continue doing what I Know makes me unhappy. I can't explain it in person. My work is being effected my health is being effected. Idk what to do. Idk who I am. I feel worthless. I feel disconnected. It's like a nightmare clenching onto my dreams. They're screaming to be seen while being taken over by shadows. I have so many plans I must see through but I can't and it fucking sucks. I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate Idk how reddit works I'm just really going downhill and needed to at least write.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of depression that are impacting the poster's motivation, confidence, and overall happiness. They mention being aware of various strategies to fight depression, such as taking care of physical health and practicing meditation, but they struggle to implement these strategies. The post also mentions the use of marijuana as a coping mechanism, which may be exacerbating their negative thoughts and feelings. The poster expresses a sense of disconnection and feeling lost, as well as feeling like their dreams are being overshadowed by negativity. This suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from their own sense of self and their goals, which is likely contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: I happened upon this site: https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/sleep-deprivation-effective-as-an-anti-depressant-for-nearly-half-of-depressed-patients-291910 Even before I found this info, I noticed that when I miss a night's sleep, I get less 'me', that is, sad, afraid and ashamed. It's like a part of my inhibitions goes and my brain is too focused on task at hand to torment me with my usual existential and emotional angst. What do you think? Disclaimer: this is by no means an encouragement to do this on your own. Talk to your doctor first, to see if it won't exacerbate your symptoms.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's experience with sleep deprivation and how it affects their mental state. They describe feeling less sad, afraid, and ashamed when they miss a night's sleep, suggesting that the lack of sleep provides temporary relief from their usual existential and emotional angst. This indicates a sense of alienation from their emotions and mental state, as well as a potential coping mechanism (albeit not recommended) to alleviate their distress."

Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions pushing away someone they loved and feeling alone as a result. They express feelings of regret and self-hatred, as well as a loss of motivation and enjoyment in activities they used to enjoy. The post also indicates a desire for help. These symptoms suggest that the cause of the mental disorder is related to relationship issues and the loss of a loved one."
"Post: I just had my 28th birthday January 2 and leading up to it, on it and since my anxiety has been on a whole new level which for me is really saying something. I’m having mini “episodes” of depersonalization and panic attacks thinking how I am 28 years old and I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember so what real hope do I have of changing. Turning 30 and being like this horrifies me and honestly I think if I’m still like this by then I might have to end it as much as I don’t want to die, I don’t see the point in going on like this. But rly if I’ve been like this since I was a kid and I’m 28 now how in the hell is it reasonable to think I could change my brain and actually improve. I look at ppl I know from high school my age already married with houses and kids or kids on the way and I want to throw up at how pathetic my own life is and how feeble I am. The lives these ppl lead my own age traveling all around the world and I can barely make it through a day at work just to get home and collapse into my bed feeling like I just ran a marathon and then got hit by a truck because of the never ending physical nature of this disease. I had an uncle that killed himself years back and my 32 year old cousin killed him self last year. It scares me that this runs in my family especially since I can honestly say that both my uncle and cousin were doing much better than I am at my age both at least had families and were functioning, so what hope is there for me?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing high levels of anxiety, depersonalization, panic attacks, and feelings of hopelessness about changing their situation. The poster compares themselves to others their age who are married, have houses and children, and lead fulfilling lives, which adds to their feelings of inadequacy and alienation. They also mention a family history of suicide, which exacerbates their fear about their own mental health. This sense of isolation and disconnection from others, as well as the belief that their struggles are inherent and unchangeable, points to alienation as the cause of their mental disorders."
"Post: I'm thinking about getting some help and Have a few questions on what to expect if I did. I'm also in the UK if that helps. If I were to go and see a GP and they prescribed something, how much would they usually prescribe? Is it a large amount of medication? Does it state whether they are anti-depressants usually? Also if i were prescribed medication would I be asked to attend a follow up appointment at some point? If so how often?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not mention any specific factors that could be contributing to the mental disorders.

"Post: Today is my day off and all I’ve done is move from my bed to my couch. When I’m not at work, I’m constantly laying in bed and sitting on my phone. It’s been like this for years. I don’t know how I’m not 400lbs. My best friends fiancé killed himself recently and I told myself I needed to seek therapy soon because I’m afraid of doing the same to my family. It’s easy to say I’ll go, but hard to actually do it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the recent suicide of the poster's best friend's fiancé, which indicates a significant relationship loss and trauma. The poster also expresses fear of potentially harming their own family and a desire to seek therapy.

"Post: My therapist tried to introduce a breathing method to reduce anxiety, which I am sure works. For real normal people. He was saying things like ""If you breathe when you are stressed you'll be able to feel happier and less afraid"" ""But I don't really think I feel any emotions other than fear..."" ""Well my job isn't to make you happy, it's to help you deal with your anxiety"". ""But I don't feel those emotions...that won't help me..."" Useless. They don't understand or care. Ignoring all of this, for the sake of argument lets ignore the fact that human life doesn't matter. Who are they to say we don't have the right to death? Why do they get to decide that? Why do they get to say that? I am not a human. I am a husk. A shell. Those methods will not help me. Therapy is just a waste of money, don't do it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the mental disorders experienced by the poster are caused by bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others."
"Post: I bought myself a late christmas gift(even though I didn't deserve it as I wasted another year). Doesn't really matter what it is - it was broken. I could just get a refound from the store, but I couldn't make a call, instead sit in my room and cryed like a bitch. I feel like shit now.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling like they don't deserve a gift and wasted another year, indicating a sense of self-judgment and dissatisfaction.

Post: I’m at the point where I’m past sadness I just feel empty or hollow. I go through the motions of life everyday but I’m not present . I’m supposed to be getting better but I’m becoming something much worse and I live in my head all the time. I can’t care about anyone anymore and I certainly don’t care about myself.

I just don’t see the point in trying anymore  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation.

"Post: That is one of my rare social outings. I am in my 40's and have social anxiety among other things. Never been in a relationship. I don't go out of the house much except for my work and running my needed errands. Prefer being at home but also wish I had the desire to go out and enjoy myself.

"Post: Since my middle school I've developed a ,,mask'' to hide my feelings. When I go out to school or with my friends I ,,put it on'' and pretend to be ok. Even in home I wear it to hide myself from my parents and sister. Only at night (00:00 or 1am) I put it off. Then I cry and memories about hate return. I hate myself. Everything I do. I don't know what to do because I don't know who I am now.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions wearing a ""mask"" to hide their true feelings and pretending to be okay when they are not. They also mention wearing this mask at home to hide from their family.

"Post: Last year had been pretty rough for me. Mostly it's the crippling depression and anxiety I'm struggling with, there were ups and downs and I'm surviving. Though recently I've felt like there were a lot of good things happening in 2017, that 2017 was actually a pretty good year. I decided to spend my night alone in my room because I need a rest from spending my nights with meaningless distractions. Basically just gonna have a nice sleep at 10pm after writing a resolution letter for my future self. But boy I'm still widely awake by now. Now I'm alone, no one seems to care about me, not even my family. I don't have any friends. My eyes are super red right now. I wanna die. All the good thoughts from this past week had gone suddenly. I thought I was safe.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions struggling with depression and anxiety, which are mental disorders that can be influenced by various factors. However, the post specifically highlights feelings of loneliness and lack of support from family and friends. The poster expresses a sense of isolation and despair, stating that no one seems to care about them and that they do not have any friends. These relationship-related issues, along with the sudden shift from positive thoughts to thoughts of wanting to die, indicate that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to relationships."
"Post: This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing. Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it. And still no one asking about me in the main chat. It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier. This is just cruel. I'm not looking forward to our next game when I have to be around them...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post describes the poster's feelings of exclusion and hurt due to their D&D group not including them in their plans for a New Year's party. They express their disappointment and longing for the group to think about them and include them. This sense of being excluded and feeling left out in social situations can cause mental disorders related to relationships, such as feelings of loneliness, rejection, and low self-esteem. Therefore, the assigned label is relationship."
"Post: I really consider suicide, i really have no strength to fix things. I keep crying all the time because I'm so hopeless! I just want to end it forever. It's so hard to keep my happy face.

Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is feeling isolated and hopeless, considering suicide as an option to escape their current state. They mention crying all the time and feeling like they have no strength to fix things. This sense of alienation and despair is likely contributing to their mental disorders and thoughts of suicide."
"Post: The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping. Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance. So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way. Thank you for listening, I hope it makes more sense than I think it does.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing multiple sexual assaults in the past few years, which indicates a history of bias or abuse. The poster also mentions frustration with their parents and their own financial struggles, suggesting that they may have experienced additional forms of bias or abuse within their family or social environment. The mention of panic attacks and the need for therapy further indicate the presence of mental disorders resulting from these traumatic experiences."
"Post: I can't stand to do anything else. I always have to distract myself with these fantasy worlds. I hate everything else. I hate being alive. I want to kill myself. I can't bear to do this anymore. My life is just one distraction after another. Everything else makes me too anxious. Too many wasted opportunities, too much wasted time, and too much bullshit in my past to make my future at all worthwhile. I feel so trapped. I can't wait until New Years. I don't remember ever spending a New Years with anyone.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong sense of disconnect and isolation from others. The poster mentions constantly needing to distract themselves with fantasy worlds and hating everything else in their life. They express feelings of wanting to kill themselves and feeling trapped.

"Post: About two months ago I started working my first retail job at a grocery store chain, and everything was fine until they decided to move me to a different department that I can't stand being in, as well as changing my hours completely. Most people say that the front end isn't that bad, but it is for me. They won't let me move somewhere else, so I decided I wasn't going to deal with it, and ghosted instead of giving a two week notice like you should do. I've been lying this entire week about going to work, and instead I've been reading books on mental illness at my public library and staying there until my ""shift"" is over. My mom wanted to know my shedule for next week, and I showed her that it was empty, meaning they fired me, but I didn't tell her that and she thought they were just giving me the week off, which is an impossibility in retail. I start college in two weeks, and now I won't have a paycheck coming every week, but I can't bring myself to care all that much. I noticed I've been much more reckless when driving by myself lately, too. I almost got T boned after leaving the library yesterday and felt nothing. No fear. Just nothing. I wish I could work at the library, it's usually quiet around there...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post clearly states that the poster is experiencing distress and dissatisfaction related to their job. They mention being moved to a department they can't stand, having their hours changed, and feeling trapped in a job they dislike. The poster also mentions lying about going to work and instead spending time at the library reading books on mental illness, indicating a negative impact on their mental well-being due to their job. The post also mentions feeling reckless when driving, possibly indicating a lack of motivation or care related to their job situation. Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's job and career."
"Post: All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen. This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. It's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Fuck everything.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of struggling to fit in, stress, anxiety, and depression, which suggests pre-existing mental health issues. However, the focus of the post is on the poster's relationship with a girl who they describe as their first meaningful romantic connection. They mention that this relationship brought them hope and happiness, but after the girl attempted suicide, their relationship changed drastically. The girl pushes the poster away, dumps them, and has a negative outlook on life. This sudden change in the relationship and the girl's mental state is causing distress for the poster and exacerbating their own mental health issues. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the tumultuous relationship and the emotional impact of the girl's mental health struggles."
"Post: It isnt because i am told the whole time im playing games to kill myself. It is because i used to think that I dont need friends i have plenty on the internet. I have lost most of those ""friends"" that i had when i said that but now i only have 2 or 3 and i am lonely and wish that i would just die but i cant bring myself to do it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing negative comments and bullying while playing games online, which suggests a negative relationship or interactions with others. The poster also mentions feeling lonely and wishing to die, indicating a lack of supportive relationships and possibly a sense of alienation. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their relationship experiences."
"Post: Apparently, my issues are too much for medications and therapy to handle. The doctors have no further suggestions but ECT. It's not really scary like many believe it to be, but for some other reason I'm scared as hell to have it done. I don't really know what else to do though. I'm sick about it. I'm sick about everything. Does anyone have any experiences with it?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that medications and therapy have not been effective in addressing the poster's issues, and the doctors have only suggested electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a possible treatment option. The poster also expresses fear and uncertainty about undergoing ECT. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorder may be related to the lack of effectiveness of medications and the anxiety surrounding the prospect of ECT as a treatment."
"Post: I've been content with the idea of seeking professional help for a while now. I've been really pushing for it for the past couple years, actually. But seeing the forms makes it feel so *real* now, I just started crying. On one hand, I'm fucking relieved that I finally get to go. On the other, I feel so bad about myself because of how much I *need* to go. How do I not burst into tears when I go in for my first appointment? Because I'm thinking that I might. What if my mind goes blank and I can't speak? How did you guys deal with this?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster has been contemplating seeking professional help for their mental health for a while, indicating a sense of alienation and disconnection from others. They mention feeling relieved but also feeling bad about themselves for needing to go to therapy, which suggests they may be experiencing self-judgment or a fear of being judged by others. They also express anxiety about the first appointment and potential difficulties in expressing themselves. All of these factors point towards a sense of alienation and the fear of not being understood or accepted by others."
"Post: I have never felt so bad, I'm feeling like going to the bathroom and poisoning myself instantly since I'm finally brave enough to kill myself. I have no one, Fucked up my future, disappointed my parents and family (many times), I'm useless and all I do is, is to waste space. Got no one to talk to except some good internet friends, I might finally kms now.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling alone and having no one to talk to except for internet friends. The poster expresses feelings of worthlessness and disappointment in themselves, which suggests a deep sense of disconnection and alienation from others. This sense of alienation and lack of support is likely a contributing factor to their suicidal thoughts and mental distress."
Post: All day I feel overwhelmingly hopeless. The idea of doing this for even 20 more years is terrifying. Im going to be alone forever. Im going to keep making people's lives worse. Im going to keep failing at everything I do. Im ready to go. Im ready to jump off a building.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests a deep sense of hopelessness and despair, as well as a feeling of being alone and isolated. The statements about being alone forever and making people's lives worse indicate a belief that they are disconnected from others and unable to form meaningful relationships.

"Post: Welp, I made it to 2018, these past few months have been absolutely terrible yet filled with many good memories, and I've met new people and made new friends too. Things are looking okay so far, I'm talking to a sweet and kind girl that I hope I can have a future with, and I've found something to be excited about. That something being music, specifically Metal and Dungeon Synth. I've also gathered a bit of energy and motivation and can hopefully use that to lose weight and learn some instruments. Hopefully things stay this way, because I'm still a sad fuck and any little thing can send me back to where I was a couple nights ago. Lonely, crying, and wanting to scatter my brains around my room because I felt like a worthless angry fuck. Well, I still feel the same but it isn't as bad as it was then. Man, I really hope I can improve this year, I don't want to make it my last.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions several positive experiences and goals, such as meeting new people, making new friends, talking to a sweet and kind girl, and finding excitement in music. However, the poster also mentions feeling like a sad and angry person, feeling lonely, and having thoughts of self-harm.

"Post: I have been having some things happen to me which I think might be related to depression. The only thing is that I am not sad and don’t have self confidence problems either, but have some other things which sound like depression. I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don’t feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can’t hear it), and sometimes I don’t make any facial expressions so people think that I don’t like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober. I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don’t want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like “do it, stab them in the neck” or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can’t put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me “are you ok?” This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can’t remember. All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated. TLDR: I think something is changed with me  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior. Although the post mentions a big life change of moving away to college, it does not specifically mention any difficulties or stress related to their job or career. Therefore, the assigned label is None."
"Post: Just read an article saying that the president-elect will undo many executive orders his first day in office. I'm positive this will include DACA, which means I will lose my work permit. Just thinking about having to go back to my birth country is stressing me out so much. I don't want to leave my home, the U.S. This announcement and so many things that have happened in my life just seem like signs that I don't belong in this life. I've been holding onto a bit of hope for the past 7 years, but I see that things just get worse. I wasn't sure if I would make it to 2017, but now I'm 99.9% sure I won't make it to 2018.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the potential loss of the poster's work permit due to changes in government policy, causing significant stress and a sense of not belonging. The post also mentions feeling hopeless and expressing thoughts of not wanting to live. These feelings and thoughts are likely a result of the uncertainty and fear of losing the ability to work and remain in their current home country. Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to jobs and career."
"Post: I'm 13, and I'm asking about what my future will be like with my depression after I move out. Can any older people tell me about living on my own with depression?

"Post: 23F here. I have depression that comes in waves, and then recedes after maybe 6-9 months, with no warning and for no apparent reason. This has been going on since I was 18. During these lows, I get suicidally depressed. I see the world through an incredibly negative filter until nothing seems to matter much at all. I often doubt that reality is even real sometimes, I feel so detached. Since nothing matters and I kinda plan on maybe killing myself soon anyway, I tend to lose my inhibitions. I tend to feel so much pain that I can't expend energy pretending to be happy or living up to society's expectations. Nothing matters, and Devin's a prick, so I'm going to tell Devin he's a prick, consequences be damned! My depression is receding again and I am cringing at the things I did when life seemed to have no purpose. I am now having to pick up the pieces of what I destroyed in my depressive period- I'm a straight A student outside of these lows, but fail most classes during them. Next semester I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's, but I'm going to have to work hard to make up for lost time to even get above a 2.0. Over the last few months I have cried in public, at work...I have snapped at people- depression tends to make me extremely mean. I always suspect people hate me and have bad intentions...my own grandmother, an angel on Earth, took me shopping, and I was totally pissy the entire time. This is partially because depression makes me feel physically horrible, exhausted and headache ridden constantly, but I still feel like an awful person. While not depressed, I drink like a sane person. While depressed, I give up on moderation completely and drink as much as I want whenever I want. Tuesday at noon? Let's get blackout drunk! There is no God anyway! Yeah, I showed up at Thanksgiving very visibly hammered, to dinner with my extended, religious family that doesn't drink. Before my depression started to melt, I just shrugged at how horrifyingly taboo this is. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME? I'M BEYOND HOPE ANYWAY!!! HATE ME LIKE YOU ALREADY DO!!! Yeah, my lows are VERY low. Now I'm back to the outgoing, relatively high achieving, sane human being that I am half of the time and it's like waking up the morning after drinking realizing how horrible and embarrassing all of your actions the night before were.

"Post: I’m trying to get out of my depression and bought a couple of self help/ motivation books to help me. I thought it would be easy filling out the answers but the first to-do was “list the things you do that make you happy”. And when it all came down to it, all my answers were either things that give me validation (love or praise) or things that are fun but don’t truly make me happy (talking to friends) or things that just give me comfort (staying in bed / no responsibilities). I don’t even know what really makes me happy...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: I've got an obsession with time, so much so I think I'm losing my mind. I don't really know if it's because I'm depressed or not, but just today I quit my job because wasting away for a full 8 hours a day feels like I'm being enslaved by corporate juggernauts. Monday through Friday it's Wake up, bathe, dress, eat. Drive an hour in backed up traffic to get to the job responsible for this life sucking routine...Shit, I'm 10 minutes late. Boss is gonna threaten my lively hood for such a simple mistake. ""Stop crying, at least you get paid. You should be grateful for those hours and all that money you made"". Yeah that's what my parents say. I can understand the reason but I just don't see it that way. Dress the part, smile and Kiss ass at a job that you hate in hopes for a promotion, 4 years go by and that door still hasn't opened. I hate it. I'm looking at the clock and its 2:28 AM, I've been up all night drinking and thinking about the day life ends. Hopefully soon. I'm only 25 yet It feels like I've reached the end of the line. Life is just a constant struggle of standing in line and trying to survive. No girlfriend, kids, friends, a broken family. It's just me, myself and I and Mrs. Brandy. I've contributed nothing to society and why should I? Society has given me nothing but pain and disdain for everything around me. Some stupid motherfucker gets in front of a camera and shows the world how stupid they are for 5 minutes. Now all of a sudden they have millions and have the fucking balls to say that they started a business!? Yeah society loves that shit. Hitting subscribe, follow, retweet, Keep feeding and endorsing it. I went to school, college, got a job and in the end I'm just another nobody with nothing to show for it. That shit gets to me. I feel uneasy posting this, not out of fear. I just don't usually share my problems, because hell nobody cares. Don't try and tell me things will get better, I'm past that. I've accepted the fact that most of us are destined to be trapped like rats in a maze for some sort of sick experiment. No matter what route you take there is no exit....except one.

"Post: There's something so derpressing about dedicating a 'celebration' about a massive chunk of time passing. Even worse when you know you have to start the new year still depressed! Last year was so shit and i was happy to put it to bed but then when I was out I realised that I'm still going into the new one the same... I think nye is so hard and I hope some of you on this subreddit did have a nice time! Here's to 2018, hopefully the year of change!

"Post: Hey r/depression. I am in therapy (although very irregularly due to financial restrictions) and I have loving friends and family members yet I do not know how to ask for help. I saw my therapist last week for the first time in a few months (I was doing absolutely awful during those) and pretended like everyhing is okay. I have talked to her about my issues before and she even helped me find a psychiatrist. My friends and some family members also offer support and repeatedly tell me that I just need to hit them up if I need help. Because I feel like I'm just a burden on everyone who has ever interacted with me before I never do so. How the hell do I get over myself and actually ask others for help? What would I even say? I can't just walk up to someone and go ""I want to die and I feel like I am unable to cope with just existing."" tl;dr not able to ask for help because I feel like I annoy everyone. How do I get over this issue?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of being a burden on others and not wanting to ask for help because of the fear of annoying people. This suggests a sense of alienation and a lack of connection with others, which may be contributing to the mental disorders experienced by the poster.

Post: Earlier this year my uncle was looking for someone to work for him. The job was very interesting to me. It's the kind of job I was truly interested in. Long story short I needed to go to school for a course that took 4 months to work for my uncle. Once I was done with the course my uncle told me he had already found someone else. But here's the thing. He's the one who found the course and told me to go and do it. I was so ready for the job and I feel so frustrated that I did the course for basically no good reason. It really felt like my golden ticket for a better life and now I can't find a job anywhere.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"jobs and career.

"Post: It's not going well. Failed business ventures. Midlife crises. Parents at the end of their respective lines and ready for the trash bins. Siblings being beaten by their terribly scripted lives. I am having a hard time relating to anyone anymore about anything. I am always trying to fix it all, and I am always failing miserably, after all this time and all these years. It's always the same thing. It's like a funny story I have told too often. I still find it funny, but I don't laugh any more. I liken it to having a serious head cold that won't go away. It pounds like mad and all I can do is hope it runs its course. And, it never runs its course. The real irony, however, is as worthless as I feel, I still can't help feeling lonely.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions multiple stressors in the poster's life, including failed business ventures, midlife crisis, and difficult family situations. They express a sense of not being able to relate to others and feeling like a failure in trying to fix things.

"Post: Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear. So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes. The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but... This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks. Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How do you cope? TL;DR: I kept buying socks while super depressed. Started doing laundry and now have a fuckton of them. Wat do.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of depression and hoarding behavior in relation to the poster's bedroom. They discuss their cleanliness standards and how they would frequently buy new socks and underwear instead of doing laundry.

"Post: https://imgur.com/a/VxDwF So, I was rummaging through my folders to organise them since they're a mess. I found some things - On the left, is a note my mum mailed to me at the start of my first year of Uni as she knows how homesick I was, even though it had only been about 2 weeks since I left home. On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me. (Spider-Dan is another nickname of mine) in it, he thanks me for being the best brother he could have and drew a picture of himself and I fighting against a monster whilst I was super saiyan. Seeing these two items instantly made me burst into tears. I just sat here crying, feeling completely broken. Guilty of the way I feel and how I want to die, knowing I have family that loves me. I don't want to be a disappointment to my mum, I want to make her proud of me. I don't want my sister and little brother to lose their big brother. I want to look out for them both and be there for them. It can be so hard to carry on. Everyday I wake up not wanting to be alive, but I don't show it. I don't care about myself anymore. However, maybe things such as this are a reason to at least try.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the emotional reaction to finding a note from the poster's mom and a birthday card from their little brother. They describe feeling broken, guilty, and wanting to die despite having family that loves them. They express a desire to make their family proud and be there for them.

"Post: My life is so monotonous... I wake up, go to school, come home and play video games, sleep and repeat. The only enjoyment I've had my winter break or the past few years is when I get high with hydrocodone or other pills. Haven't left my house to do anything in years. (Besides school which is hell as well.) No one ever texts me or care s so I dont see the point in living anymore! I'm tired of being alone, unhappy and worthless. The best part is I'm currently out of pills which is the only thing that is making me feel somewhat good. I guess a gun will have to do ""Suicide all in my head, Why the world don't care about no one else's life till they already dead""  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's monotonous and unhappy life, as well as their reliance on medication (hydrocodone or other pills) to find enjoyment and relief from their negative emotions. They express feeling alone, unhappy, and worthless, and even mention suicide as an option. The use of medication as a means of escape and the negative emotions and thoughts expressed suggest that the cause of their mental disorders in this post is related to medication use and dependency."
Post: Everyone on here he keeps telling me to get help. I think I have borderline personality disorder but I heard doctors don't like people with bpd. Im scared they will just call me crazy or put me on pills that make me sleep or make my hair fall out. I'm too scared to go to therapy. I don't like talking to people about my problems.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the fear of doctors and therapists potentially stigmatizing them or prescribing medications with unwanted side effects. It also expresses a general discomfort with talking to people about their problems.

Post: My brain is maybe telling different but I can't believe it. I don't believe that anybody on this world can be real friends with me. Maybe some do but I can't trust in it.

"Post: 2017 for me was the equivalent of putting a load of expensive and high-end ingredients into a pot, cooking it, and having it taste rancid in the end. I had such great experiences and growth this year, but it feels like it hasn't given me the fulfilment I really want. I can't really tell this to anyone I know, since they'll think I am ungrateful or spoiled. My friends think I have everything going great for me, but those persistent nagging thoughts don't seem to agree. Anyone else feel this way or can relate?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels disconnected from their friends and unable to openly express their true feelings.

Time to talk to someone who knows how to respond, and hear me blabber on my meaningless bullshit.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a desire to talk to someone who knows how to respond and listen to their thoughts and concerns. This suggests a need for emotional support and a relationship with a therapist or counselor who can provide that support.

Post: I stopped when I got pregnant but I had to weigh the risks. I haven’t been myself in months. I’m miss having hobbies. I miss enjoying my old hobbies. Nothing appeals to me anymore.

Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's change in behavior and lack of enjoyment in activities since getting pregnant. They also mention not feeling like themselves and feeling tired of the way they are feeling.

"Post: I wonder about this a lot. On one hand, depression is absolutely horrible and I often wish it away. On the other, would I be who I am today without it? I know that if I didn't have depression, my self identity would be entirely different. How does depression shape you to be who you are, and do you think it's for the better or worse?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior.

"Post: I can't really explain what's up with my mind, but today I sent everyone my final goodbye to them, the way they behaved makes me want to die more, now I am determined to do so  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling misunderstood and mistreated by others, leading to a desire to die. This suggests a strong sense of alienation and disconnection from others, as the poster feels that their experiences and emotions are not validated or understood by the people around them.

"Post: I've personally thought about it -- several times a week when times were bad, and each time it was ruled out as a non-viable solution. I do, however, consider it an option on the table if circumstances call for it. The issue I want to address is the stigma on suicide. I know people that have been clinically depressed for decades, and I've watched them take no joy out of life. Why prolong it if you've been dealt a shitty hand? Is society being selfish in wanting to see that people can change for the better just to affirm its own views of the world? The mere mention of suicide brings throngs of people trying to ""help"", and often instilling false hope. Will we ever ever say, ""yeah, it's a shitty situation. Offing yourself is probably the best option."" There is no cure for clinical depression, and I bet those who eventually do kill themselves were dragged through the mud before they did it, effectively prolonging their suffering. If time is an endowed right, each of us should have the freedom to choose what we do with it. If your friend had been served a bland dish, would you ask him or her to try to savor the ""silver lining""?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post mentions considering suicide as an option and discussing the stigma surrounding it. However, it does not mention any specific causes or factors contributing to the individual's mental state. While there is mention of clinical depression and a critique of society's response to suicide, there is no clear indication of bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication, relationship issues, or alienation as the cause of the mental disorders being discussed. Therefore, the assigned label is ""None."""
"Post: The only social media I use often are Youtube and Reddit. I have a Facebook account, but there are no pictures or info and I don't go on it often. I gave in and was curious about what people were posting on New Year's Eve...and I immediately regretted it. Most people were posting their 2017 highlights and boy did they make me feel worthless. One that really got to me was the one who posted about their engagement, moving into their own place together, graduating college, traveling, etc. I just broke down crying for 10 minutes straight after reading her post. 2017 for me was a blur. I cannot give you any highlights of my life because there weren't any for me. Just a lot of crying and regrets. I have no friends or social life, so it's really hard for me to do anything eventful. I just sit in my room alone trying to pass time with the internet. I hate it so much. It is ironic with me because I hate how much technology has advanced (social media wise) and how people are always on their devices nowadays, yet when you look at me .. I am doing what I hate other people doing. Sometimes I feel like if I grew up in the 80s, my life wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't have a computer, phone, etc to occupy me so I would not feel tired or useless and instead put effort into making friends. To anyone who read this, thank you so much. I don't post on here very often and just wanted to feel less alone by interacting with you all (since I am of course not doing anything exciting for new years). Happy New Years to you all regardless. Hope you guys have/had a better day than me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling worthless and experiencing intense emotions after reading about other people's achievements and highlights on social media, particularly regarding relationships, engagements, moving in together, graduating, and traveling.

"Post: Does anyone else find that they’re suicidal only when they’re alone? I am entirely dependent on others (mainly my fiancé), in the sense that I can’t be alone. “Can’t” meaning I very quickly spiral down.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling suicidal only when alone and being dependent on others, particularly their fiancé, for support. This suggests that the poster's mental disorder is directly related to their relationship and the fear and instability they experience when they are alone."
"Post: Hey everyone, I've been lurking for awhile now and since its 2017, I want to start fresh. 2016 was my lowest point and I still feel so lonely and depressed. I've been seeking happiness in someone and it just seems like she is getting colder and colder. I just feel so lost and there seems to be nothing I can do. Some days I just feel so unloved after trying so hard to start a conversation with her. I should be happy since I have all I need but I just feel so depressed and horrible. But anyways how do I love myself and find happiness with me or from within? How do I finally find a way to not rely on others for the key to happiness? Thanks for the reply in advance.

This sense of alienation and opposition may be contributing to the mental disorders indicated in the post."
"Post: **Trigger warnings for probably everything.** For me, 2017 has been the shittest year for a while. It can go fuck itself. So, for one night only. I'm going to get drunk and direct all of the vitriol and negativity I usually spend on myself, at an entire year. From January to December. It can all get fucked. All of the darkest thoughts I have about me and others. For tonight, they're all for you, 2017. I hope you'll all join me in posting the nastiest things you can think of about yourself or anyone. And direct it at 2017. Tonight, it deserves it more than you. Normal self-loathing service can be resumed tomorrow. It's gonna get dark. * 2017, I hope you die in a house fire. * 2017, if you ever have kids. I hope they get abducted. * 2017, I hope you get not-quite terminal cancer in all of your toilet-parts and then get hooked on painkillers and end up selling your arse for heroin money as your family and friends look on and laugh. * 2017, I hope all of your loved ones die in a car crash. * 2017, you're not worthy of kindness. * 2017, you deserve nothing. * 2017, I hope you get pregnant and both you and your baby die in labour. * 2017, I hope your dog stops loving you. * 2017, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. In fact the only time I'd even consider giving you any fluids is if you were in a burns unit, burnt from head to toe. I'd have a wank on you. And that's only if I had AIDS. Lastly, fuck you, 2017. In a few hours you'll be dead. And I'll still be here. Even though I don't really want to be. I still beat you. And that counts for at least ...something. Probably. Maybe.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not mention any specific causes or factors related to mental disorders. The content of the post suggests intense anger and negativity towards the year 2017, but does not indicate any other underlying causes such as bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation."
"Post: I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason? I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 1. Hormonal imbalance. 2. Anemia. 3. Depression. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say. You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting. But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me. The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice. I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal. He started getting abusive. Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world. He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop. He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of abuse and a traumatic experience in a past relationship. The poster discusses physical abuse, including being slapped and pushed to the wall, as well as emotional abuse through name-calling and manipulation. This history of bias and abuse within a previous relationship is likely contributing to the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
"Post: For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics. Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal. It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide. She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it. If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient. This is just not a possibility with her at this moment. There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do. I do not have much money as I am currently a college student. I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help. If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated. I am really struggling here because I can not give her the full time care she needs to get better. Thank you for listening and have a Happy New Year.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's mother's deteriorating mental health, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. It also discusses the lack of health insurance and the difficulty in accessing appropriate care. The poster expresses their struggle in finding options to help their mother and their inability to provide full-time care. This indicates that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the strained relationship between the poster and their mother, as well as the lack of support and resources available for her mental health."
"Post: My mom who's 57 years of age has fallen into depression. A choice I made that involved who I want to spend my life with has really hit her hard (girl from different culture). For a very long time she's had her views on things and it was very hard to convince her otherwise but I'm scared that the depression this time is really getting to her and might shorten her life. This is the last thing I want. I love her to death I don't want to force her to accept any decision I make I just need help in trying to get her out of her depression. We've tried as a family to get her to go to the doctor but failed. She's always been creative and outgoing but since we talked about my decision, she's barley left the house, gained weight, and is in constant anger. I don't know what to do and to add to all of this I'm not there with her. I live away from my family and that's made it even harder. Any advice would be appreciated. Her cultural background is Arab if that helps at all.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's mother falling into depression after the poster made a choice regarding who they want to spend their life with, specifically mentioning that the girl is from a different culture. The post also mentions the mother's change in behavior, including not leaving the house, gaining weight, and experiencing constant anger. The post expresses concern for the mother's well-being and asks for advice on how to help her. These factors indicate that the mental disorder is likely caused by the strained relationship between the mother and the poster, specifically related to the cultural differences and the impact of the poster's decision on the mother's emotional state."
"Post: Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends. For everyone else, I only talk about depression in a comedic manner, making jokes about it and laughing. I do that because I feel I’m supposed to be the fun one in the group, and while I think I am (I always make them and myself laugh), if I get super serious they’ll either make fun of me, stop being my friend, or get super worried and tell someone. I don’t want any of those to happen. Anyway, back to my best friend. Since she’s the one I’m serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. I’m starting to feel like I’m being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesn’t need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really don’t want to annoy her with how much I’ve been telling her. Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and she’s been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel that’s the truth. Anyway, sorry about how long this was. I could go on and on about this, so I hope you understand.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's limited ability to open up to others about their depression and suicidal thoughts. They mention that they feel the need to maintain a comedic facade with their friends in order to fit in and avoid judgment. However, with their best friend, they feel comfortable discussing their true feelings and struggles. The poster expresses concern about burdening their best friend with their issues and worries that their depressive texts may have negatively impacted their friend's mental health. This indicates that the main cause of the mental disorder in this post is related to the weight of the poster's relationship and the fear of being a burden on their best friend."
"Post: I have no happiness in my life at all, I try and distance myself emotionally from my family because it's easier that way than feeling guilt and them not understanding. Not even music or tv shows give me a moment of happiness I just feel disgust and more sadness. It would just be better if I died Usually I use music and tv as a coping mechanism In trying to destruct myself but it's not working anymore and I'm scared at this point  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a lack of happiness in the poster's life and their attempts to distance themselves emotionally from their family. They also mention that music and TV, which they typically use as coping mechanisms, are no longer providing any happiness. This indicates a sense of alienation and disconnection from both their family and their usual sources of comfort. The poster's feelings of disgust, sadness, and fear further suggest that their mental disorder is likely caused by a sense of alienation and isolation."
"Post: I've gone up to a higher dosage of Abilify and I've been taken off my sleeping pills because I tried to kill myself with them. I'm on some antihistamine for night time anxiety and it works pretty well, but my days are still hell. I just wanna be sedated and not feel a thing.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does mention medication (Abilify and antihistamine) and suicidal thoughts, suggesting that mental disorders may be present. However, the post does not provide any specific information or context regarding the cause of these mental disorders. Therefore, the assigned label is ""None"" as there is not enough information to determine the cause."
"Post: I'm so fucking stupid. I should've kept pretending like everything was ok. I finally opened up to 2 of my best friends about how I've been suicidal recently. They got really upset and started telling me how selfish that is, and they're right. I knew they've both dealt with suicidal thoughts before, and it was insensitive to bring it up around them. Since then they stopped talking to me. I've never felt worse about myself and dealing with it alone isn't helping. At this point I'm ready to die. I'm failing out of school, I can't start a relationship, my autism is getting worse, and I won't even have a place to live next month when I turn 18. My one reason for not ending it already were the few friends that I did have, but now they're gone too, so I don't have a reason to stay alive anymore  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is experiencing multiple difficulties in their life, including suicidal thoughts, failing school, worsening autism symptoms, and the loss of friends and housing stability. While medication may be a helpful treatment option for individuals with these challenges, it is not explicitly mentioned in the post as a cause or factor contributing to the mental disorders described. Therefore, the assigned label is None."
"Post: It seems like I was put into a family and city I don't belong in. So of course I tried to move around to find the right place but since it was right after highschool , I never found a good enough job to sustain myself, so I came home and went back to school. I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself. The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried. Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash. Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world. My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place. Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression. This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral . I have been doing good depression wise. Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contiplated ending it . Tomorrow im terrified because once it happens I know I'll loss all hope. If anyone can send any sort of encouragement it would mean everything. Thank you all.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling like they don't belong in their family and city, and their struggles to find a job. They also describe the negative backlash and criticism they receive from their father, who calls them a loser and threatens to kick them out. This emotional and verbal abuse from a family member, combined with their current situation of being on the verge of homelessness, is likely causing significant mental distress for the poster. They mention struggling with anxiety and depression, as well as feeling a loss of motivation and contemplating ending their life. These factors suggest that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their relationship with their family and the current state of their living situation."
"Post: I’ve (24m) been suffering from depression for about the past three years and nobody but a couple of health care professionals know this about me. Maintaining my image is rough. I’m in excellent physical shape, on track to a “successful” future, seemingly happy, and I get along with everybody. People have no idea that working hard in the gym, school and work is just the way I cope. I throw myself into any type of work I find to keep myself so busy I can’t think about how unhappy I am. I don’t really have any close friends, I hate my family, I haven’t been intimate with a girl in 6 years, and i just feel like a complete outsider everywhere I go. I fantasize about awesome ways I could die (eg die trying to save a baby in a burning house) so people don’t think of me as another victim to depression. I guess I just really hate feeling people’s sympathy. I refuse to be seen as a victim and it’s what keeps me going despite the complete lack of joy I have in life.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling like an outsider, not having any close friends, hating their family, and not being intimate with a girl in 6 years. These factors contribute to a sense of loneliness, isolation, and dissatisfaction in relationships. The poster also mentions fantasizing about ways to die so that people don't see them as a victim of depression, indicating a strong desire to avoid sympathy and maintain a certain image. These relationship-related issues, combined with the desire to cope through work and maintaining a certain image, suggest that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to relationships."
Post: I cannot handle this  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: There isn't enough information provided in the post to definitively determine the cause of the mental disorder. The post simply states ""I cannot handle this"" without any further context or details about the specific situation or factors contributing to the inability to handle it. Therefore, assigning a cause label based solely on this vague statement is not possible."
"Post: Every time you try to be happy, it's fleeting. Like the man trying to roll a boulder up a mountain and he never gets it to the top. You try to fill your ballon. Try to be happy. Than somebody with their needle pops it. I get tired of my balloons popping. Happiness is fleeting with bubbles popping. Wish I could make one ballon and protect but I know it will splatter from needles and pins. Had to get this off my chest.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest any specific cause for the mental disorders described. It discusses the feeling of fleeting happiness and the frustration of having that happiness repeatedly disrupted, but it does not mention any specific factors such as bias or abuse, job stress, medication, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation that may contribute to these feelings. Therefore, the assigned label in this case is ""None."""
"Post: I feel nothing. I have been feeling like this for a long time. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel sad, but for the most part I don't feel anything at all. I think the last time I cried was probably 10 years ago. Two days ago I was watching Bojack Horseman, and one of the episodes hit me for some reason. It was in season two, when Bojack started crying outside the library. Something clicked with me and I started crying too. I was crying for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I just sat there and cried. In silence, alone. I don't know why, but after I stopped, I was happy. I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness. Since then I've been trying to find something to get me into that state again, but nothing even comes close. Sad songs. Rick and Morty. People talking about their life. Nothing. I just sit there and there is nothing coming out of me at all, like an empty bowl. I don't know if ever I will experience that feeling again. I hope I will. I don't know why I'm typing this.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post describes a consistent feeling of emptiness and an inability to feel emotions, except for a brief moment of happiness when the poster cried. They mention trying various things to recreate that feeling, but nothing comes close. This suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from their own emotions, as well as a longing to feel something again. The lack of emotional connection and the search for a specific feeling indicate that the cause of their mental disorder is related to alienation."
"Post: Honestly 2016 has been a pretty shit year. Being a gay 17 year old, with no father, moved halfway through high school and stuck inside his own mind with depression is awful. Lately I just feel like I have no friends or value in this life. Everyone who I thought I was close with no longer speak to me and Idk what I've done. I'm stuck in the middle of Nebraska too. I'm from the northwest and I'm stuck in buttfuck nebraska. I just feel so alone and worthless and I just wish I had someone to talk to and I just wish I loved myself cause I've hated myself for the past 7 years and not a day goes by that I don't overly criticize myself. Honestly it's new years and I wish a drunk driver would hit me  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors that contribute to a sense of alienation and loneliness. The poster mentions being a gay teenager with no father, experiencing depression, and feeling like they have no friends or value in life. They also express a desire for someone to talk to and a wish to love themselves, indicating a lack of connection and a longing for acceptance and belonging. All of these factors contribute to the poster's feelings of alienation, making it the assigned label for the cause of their mental disorders."
"Post: I'm just so tired of feeling depressed all the time, and the stuff i used to have an interest in seems to be boring most of the time. I've been feeling this for a good amount of years now because of a long story. Have anyone else any experience with weed, because i've been smoking alot lately and helps me SO MUCH with my anxiety and the ""black and white"" look at the world(please don't tell me to stop, i know the risks) Why is everything so fucking boring all the time, i feel like i am wasting my entire youth i'm 17, i don't see myself as an isolated nerd or anything i like to produce music on my computer. I consider myself decent looking depending on the day, i'm not overweight nor skinny. I'm so sick of being afraid of other people on and off all the time. I'm a virgin because i'm so scared of girls. but when i am high i can actually speak to girls and make eye contact and just rest in myself, yesterday some girl sat right next to me on an almost empty bus, and when i wanted to go out she smiled to me, and another day i was having a fun time talking with a girl at my friends house(also high at the moment). When i'm high i feel like i am my true self without a barrier trying to protect me from people. Some days i am happy and i want to go out and meet people(not very often but sometimes) and other days i am literally scared of everything waiting outside my door I am speaking with an psychologist at the moment, which is really good for me. i am taking antidepressiv in a small dose, and i have daily suicide thoughts that i have spoking with my psychologist about. I have nightmares almost every single night. I don't know myself, i don't know who i fucking am! I feel like i am missing out on all the fun Am i missing out on my youth?? I feel completely lonely in this world even though i have some friends who care about me and i have my mom. I'm sick and tired of being tired I think that when people are depressed the see the world as it actually is without filter, if you know what i mean. I have so much anger inside which sometimes lead to me getting extremely angry because of small things. I would love to have a girlfriend, and since i'm so bad at speaking with girls, i don't know how the fuck i am going to do that I would love reply :) (Sorry for the bad writing, i don't want to edit everything :) )  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and bored with life, which can be indicative of a sense of alienation from activities and interests that used to bring joy. The poster also mentions using weed to alleviate anxiety and a ""black and white"" view of the world, which suggests using substances as a coping mechanism for feeling disconnected or alienated. They express fear and difficulty in interacting with others, specifically girls, but note that when they are high, they feel more comfortable and able to be their true self. These feelings of disconnection and difficulty in building relationships, along with the use of substances as a way to cope, point to a potential cause of mental disorders related to feeling alienated from others."
"Post: tonight something strange happened. i was out with friends, we drank a little (i had about 3 drinks in 3-4 hrs) and when we left, we decided we’d go to the closest friends’ house and continue to drink. i was by no means wasted. out of no where my chest began to tighten and my heart started racing. at the last second, i asked to be dropped off at my parents’. i told my mom what happened and she suggested that it was an asthma attack. I’ve had asthma attacks, and this didnt feel like one (no wheezing/ out of breath) it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i can’t get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, it’s vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what i’m going to do in the future, a job, etc. the whole episode lasted half an hour or so. i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this?? any help is appreciated :) add on: the feeling is similar to as if someone were holding my heart and lungs in their hands, and slowly tightening their grip. not sure if that makes sense but it’s the best way i can think to describe it  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post describes the physical symptoms of tightness in the chest, racing heart, and difficulty breathing. The poster also mentions feeling stressed about life in general and experiencing the same feeling in certain positions or environments. These symptoms and triggers are consistent with panic or anxiety attacks. The poster specifically asks if anyone else experiences this and if it could be a panic or anxiety attack. Therefore, it is suggested that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to anxiety and may require medication for management."
"Post: I turn 53 in a few weeks. I feel like I have nothing left to look forward to in life. My kids are getting older and don’t really need me anymore, my body aches all the time and when I look in the mirror I see an aging, tired face. I’m getting old. I always get a kick out of those posters to this forum who are 18 or 21 and complain that they’ve had enough of life. They haven’t even gotten started yet. They have everything to look forward to. Their journeys are just beginning. But for those of us on the down side of the hill, who’ve seen too many things, who’ve tasted bitter disappointments, whose hearts have been broken so many times they can’t be repaired anymore, living every day can just be sad.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from life. The poster feels like they are on the ""down side of the hill"" and have nothing to look forward to. They compare themselves to younger individuals who have their whole lives ahead of them and express a sense of bitterness and sadness due to their experiences and disappointments. This feeling of being separated from the hope and optimism associated with youth and the future can contribute to mental disorders."
"Post: I know this sounds really superficial, but hear me out. I was doing ""okay"" for me - for a few days/hours anyway, and I saw a Chainsmokers music video, and just wanted to kill myself again. I don't know why I do this to myself  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not provide any information suggesting that the mental disorders experienced by the poster are caused by bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others. The mention of the Chainsmokers music video could imply a trigger for negative emotions, but it does not necessarily indicate a relationship-related issue."
"Post: i see all the people celebrating, all the big lights, the fireworks, the ornaments, but none of it moves me even just a little. what is new years but just another excuse for all the sheep to get belligerent, numbing themselves from the bigger picture? ""tradition""? fuck that, there's no such thing behind it. christmas and new years are a masterclass in capitalism at work. valentines, easter, halloween, etc. are all crash courses in capitalism, but new years/christmas are the phd. it makes me sick. all these sheep spending all their hard earned loot on things they think they can't live without, which really won't yield anything of substance, only one fleeting moment of feigned happiness. is it worth it? are you so miserable that retail therapy is what you turn to to feel better for one moment? all this shit is a topical anaesthetic, never getting at the meat of it. society is so doomed. culture doesn't exist anymore. we're afraid of our history. on this relentless pursuit of creating a unified world we're negating our rich cultural heritages, which can be curated to leave out the negatives. is sex really the *only* thing that matters in life? it seems it's everyones prime motive. make money. why? so you can attract cheap people who'll fuck you once they know you've got it? money is just another topical anaesthetic. might as well be monopoly money, because none of what it gets you has any real substance. the only reason you want it is so you can quench your insatiable thirst for fucking. anyone who claims sex isn't the core of it all just never got enough of it so lies to themselves, taking a fake moral high ground- fuck you. we're living in an era where plethoras of shit relationships abound. relationships formed not organically, but by way of swiping right on an app on our phones for fucks sake. absolutely repulsive, breading legions of hedonists who later in life will have to hide their pasts from their partners. ""wholesome""? what the fuck is that... a relic of a long defunct past. there's more to relationships than sex-appeal- it's those little idiosyncrasies which make you want someone in the long run; those little quirky things which make them uniquely them, which you'll never get to know just by swiping right. and even for those who don't dabble in this e-fornication, they're doing it all wrong for the most part. a great lasting relationship will only become harder and harder to find moving forward. and even those that exist, a lot of them are founded under false pretences. people are seldom honest, thinking their lies will get them ahead, but they only land you deeper in a hole. be honest with yourselves and with others. society today is pathetic. every single person, young or old, glued to their damn 'smart' devices which serve no purpose other than to dumb you down- perfect irony. i'm 28, but am living among hoards of technosheep instead of real humans who thrive off personal contact. it's sickening. everyone living their lives for your viewing pleasure, presenting you perfectly curated renditions of their ideal, which they'll never really have. everything is so shallow, never venturing to go beyond the surface. there might be factions of people who don't adhere to this new way of life, but fuck it, so what? it's only getting worse. buy, buy, buy, drink, drink, drink, fuck, fuck, fuck. i used to feel like an outsider-- an alien walking around this foreign planet--, but lately i feel like it's the other way around, like all these sheep are prancing around this perfect world and i'm seeing it for what it is.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels alienated from society and sees themselves as an outsider. They criticize societal norms and traditions, such as celebrations and consumerism, and express a disdain for the superficiality of social interactions facilitated by technology. They also mention feeling like they are seeing the world differently from others and feeling disconnected from the ""sheep"" who conform to societal norms. This sense of alienation from society and feeling like an outsider can contribute to mental disorders."
"Post: Okay so this is extremely embarrassing and I have been called everything under the sun from lazy to useless, I have been out of full time employment since 2013 with only one seasonal summer job as a parts driver for a helicopter company last summer. In my previous work place which was known as a starter company for the trade I was trying to get into I worked myself into sickness and was bullied by grown ass men into depression. This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. So this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. So I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. Now I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist. I need work, I've tried applying for everything under the sun the past few months. Every day gets harder and harder at this point I think I should just kill myself to relieve my parents of a financial burden , and a embarrassment. I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. If you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me. It's hard for me to type this out and even harder for me to hit the post button. Sorry for getting pretty emotional towards the end and also for any grammatical errors English is my second language.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions a series of negative experiences and challenges related to the poster's employment history. They mention being bullied at a previous workplace, experiencing a back injury, being laid off, and struggling to find new job opportunities in a competitive industry. These experiences have had a significant impact on their mental well-being, leading to feelings of frustration, anger, and worthlessness. The poster expresses a strong desire to find work and regain a sense of purpose and identity, indicating that their mental disorders are directly linked to their experiences in the job and career domain."
"Post: So the thing here is I stopped caring about my reputation. I care nothing about keeping a good reputation and some of my friends warned me about keeping a 'good' reputation. I seem to be the easy going and not caring kind of person, is it related to me being a girl? Is that why I have to respect everything and say that I'm good with everything other people say? Do I have to 'fake' being a polite girl? I know it's because I have different cultures but I don't feel like it's myself or me.Do I really have to change myself? Do I have to stop doing this kind of attitude? What did I do wrong here? I didn't even realised when I stopped caring about anyone or anything, it just happened. Why do I feel like crying eventhough this is just me and my stubborn ego? Am I way too rough to socialize with anyone at all? I know not many people will reply to this but it would be nice if I at least know if someone feels the same way as I do.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the conflict the poster feels regarding societal expectations for women and their own personal values and behaviors. They discuss feeling like they have to conform to certain expectations and be polite, which may be causing a sense of alienation and dissatisfaction. The post also mentions feeling like they have stopped caring about others and anything, which could indicate a breakdown in their relationships. The poster expresses a sense of loneliness and a desire to connect with others who may feel the same way, suggesting that relationship issues are likely contributing to their mental disorders."
Post: I'm fucked. Completely fucked.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post does not provide any information about the potential causes of the mental distress expressed. It simply states that the poster feels completely messed up without elaborating on any specific factors contributing to their state. Therefore, it is not possible to assign a label based on the given information."
"Post: Because sometimes that happens to me, and I’m wondering if it’s just a me thing, or...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling like something happens to the poster that may be unique to them (""just a me thing""). This suggests a sense of isolation and a feeling of being different or separate from others. The mention of wondering if it's just them implies a lack of connection or understanding from others, which can contribute to feelings of alienation and ultimately result in mental disorders."
"Post: I watched The Greatest Showman the other day, and the song “A Million Dreams” made me cry so hard. It basically details the love story between the main character and his future wife. They talk about the big dreams they have, and the fact that they picture a world where these dreams come true helps them get through today. I just kept wishing that I had someone who loved me the way they loved each other. That I could have dreams that could actually become a reality someday. That I could be someone special instead of another sad lonely person waiting for a miracle that will never happen. I guess sometimes dreams are only meant to be dreams.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling emotional and crying while watching a movie that depicts a love story. They express a longing for someone to love them in the same way and a desire for their dreams to become reality. The post also mentions feeling like a sad and lonely person. These statements suggest that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their emotions and thoughts surrounding relationships and feelings of loneliness and unfulfilled dreams.
"Post: It seems like summer depression is relatively common here so has anything been helpful for anyone to get through the summer? I've been enjoying winter way too much, and now that it's January I'm starting to dread the heat again. I live in SoCal which makes it 100x worse.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not mention any factors that would suggest bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related issues, relationship problems, or a sense of alienation as causes of the poster's feelings of summer depression.

"Post: I've recently been going to the doctor for problems with sleeping. I have bouts of insomnia, wake up feeling like I've barely slept regardless of if I've had a decent amount of sleep and feel tired through the day. I did all the tests my doctor could possibly think of and I'm perfectly healthy. When we first started my doctor asked if I felt depressed and I dismissed it because I feel the same as always. Now I'm starting to wonder if it's mental rather than physical. It's been like this for a long time, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I looked back through a few logs I kept of how I felt when I was so tired I could barely get up to go to work, and I would often write things about feeling disconnected. I haven't thought about it for awhile, but it's still there. It's not strong or oppressive or anything like that, just sort of a general sense of being in a dream, things flow past me and nothing really matters. People stop mattering, I stop caring about stuff I love, that kind of thing. So I'm starting to think that maybe I am depressed, but I have a habit of self diagnosing and scaring myself. I didn't really think about it before, since I don't feel 'sad'. But it all sounds like, at the very least, there's something mental going on that's making everything messy. Maybe it's just stress? I don't know. I think I might look into it more, talk to my doctor about it, that sort of thing. Im at the point where I don't really care what it is that's wrong, I'm just sick of feeling this way and at the very least if I know what's going on then maybe i can do something about it. If anyone read this I could use an opinion (I won't take it as gospel but it'd help), some support or even just tell me where to go if this isn't the right place. I don't mind either way, I think it's good to just vent sometimes to think things through. Thank you.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior. The focus of the post is on the poster's difficulty with sleeping and their realization that there may be a mental rather than physical cause for their symptoms. They mention feeling disconnected and a general sense of apathy towards things they used to care about, indicating the possibility of depression. However, the specific cause of the mental disorder is not clear from the post."
"Post: I'm 21 years old. I have aspergers syndrome and depression, I have struggled quite a lot and I want to do stuff my own way to get better (with the help from actual professionals). My mum, dad and step-mum won't leave me alone and they constantly make choices for me and it's starting to get to me. They make me feel unhappy and miserable. What should I do?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling unhappy and miserable due to the actions of the poster's mother, father, and step-mother. They express a desire to do things their own way to get better, indicating a lack of autonomy and control over their own life choices. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their relationships with their parents and step-parent, as their constant interference and decision-making is negatively impacting their emotional well-being."
"Post: and it is becoming difficult to stay focused. There is a loss of interest in activities I typically enjoy, a growing desire to be around/talk with friends, yet the drive to isolate is developing a storm within myself. I am in my thirties, many worries I had in my twenties are gone (job, housing, making friends). The struggle is in the remaining challenges. I value myself by how desirable I imagine I am. I define my desirability by how needed I am in mainly non-monetary ways (i.e. work doesn't really count, though it gives me some strength). Often I find more time on my hands than others, which leads me to reach out to friends much more than being reached out to instead. My friends and family say they enjoy spending time together and we make small talk about promises to connect. Many friends and family are actually busy and may only find time to connect infrequently. I can only see/share a snapshot of our lives and our connections. This makes me feel like less of a person. I want more people (two to three friends someday day) I connect with more than quarterly or annually. This has been a generally positive year. This lull has been much less severe than in prior years (during the holidays specifically). The sadness is more powerful in the duration and lack of attributable events. I want a reason to be sad, to fight or deconstruct said reason and ""bounce back"" or at least have an argument against these feelings. The hum of daily activities continues, heavy in each moment. A white noise that slowly is clouding my routine ushering me closer to the basics of eat, work, sleep, then repeat. The fog is comforting in the simplicity of the path left for me to travel, however the path is not the direction I want. I want to see around me again, I want to clearly view my challenges and triumphs, and most of all I want to feel desirable again. The time it takes to push through this cycle is exhausting. I wish to rid myself of this monotonous hum that is pushing me towards isolation. I have no real expectations of improving my situation from posting, yet I am hopeful I might be distracted for a bit by sharing. It provides a sense of value to think what I say has an impact on myself or others. Thank you for taking the time to read this, it feels good to imagine I am being heard. - 0/l  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a sense of isolation and a desire for more meaningful connections with others. The poster discusses feeling less valued as a person due to their perception of infrequent and shallow connections with friends and family. They also express a longing to be heard and to have an impact on themselves and others. This sense of alienation and disconnection is likely contributing to the mental disorders mentioned in the post.
"Post: Ah yes. Going to bed at 10 PM without eating or taking my meds after a long day of being a terrible human being and a disappointment to everybody in my life.

Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of being a terrible human being and a disappointment to everybody in their life, which suggests a low self-esteem and dissatisfaction with their relationships.

"Post: I never had much friends throughout my life. Never really hang out or play tag when I was a kid. I was a obscure kid with your self-esteem. Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didn’t tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. We’re now working adults now and well, we drifted apart. I’m at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that I’m still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I don’t think thats possible. Maybe I just hate myself, maybe I hate society for making me this way. The only thing that is make my life worth living is entertainment that keep my mind from thinking about my depression, pushing me onwards till I finally die.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions being an obscure kid with low self-esteem, occasionally getting bullied, and not sharing this information with anyone. These experiences indicate a history of bias or abuse, which likely contributed to the poster's current mental state, including feelings of unhappiness, failure, and self-hatred. The mention of finding solace in entertainment to escape depression further supports the notion that bias or abuse has played a role in their mental disorders."
"Post: It happens at least twice a week: some jerk cuts me off when I'm talking or a coworker simply ignores what I just said, and I instantly start hating on myself. ""People interrupt me because I'm a wimp."" ""I'm the only one they treat like this."" Anybody else?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions instances where the poster is being interrupted and ignored by others, which suggests a negative experience in their workplace or career. They internalize these negative interactions and start hating on themselves, indicating that their mental disorder may be related to job-related stress and feeling like they are being mistreated or not respected in their professional environment."
"Post: I've been down for the past few months, maybe longer. I moved away from home a year ago. I don't know if it's that I don't care enough, but I can't seem to make any friends and it's hurting. This is my first year ever bringing in the new year alone. I'm crying just thinking about it. On to the next day and the new year. Happy New Year.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling down for several months, possibly related to moving away from home a year ago. The poster expresses a sense of loneliness and feeling unable to make friends, which is particularly distressing for them as they will be spending New Year's Eve alone. These feelings of isolation and lack of social connection indicate that the cause of their mental disorders is related to their relationship difficulties."
"Post: This past month has hit me like a freight train with red-hot spikes on the front. A while ago, I started hooking up with this guy. He's pretty cute, he's lively, outgoing, and funny. I started getting feelings for him, but I was afraid to tell him because I was afraid of getting hurt again. But life finds a way to hurt me anyways. We hadn't talked in a while, and it made me feel like he was done with me. It sucked, but I knew it was going to happen eventually. Conveniently at this point, my ex hits me up. We start talking about how we're doing and politics (usually not good but we both enjoy talking about it), and then I noticed that he was getting....flirty? Eventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now. The whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. Life in general is terrible too. Relationship woes aside, I have one good friend, and nobody else. My brain is addled with mental disorders (autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder). My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it. I can hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, and even when I do, they just leave me more hurt than I was before. It's all just terrible, and I don't think I can handle it much longer. I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken. All that's keeping me here is my one friend, my own fear of taking myself out, and an infinitely tiny and naive glimmer of hope that I might find my way out of this and back into someone's loving arms.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions struggling with severe depression, anxiety, OCD, and possibly borderline personality disorder. The poster also mentions missing weeks of school, having difficulty forming meaningful connections, and feeling overwhelmed by life in general. These symptoms indicate that the mental disorders mentioned are likely the result of a combination of underlying psychological factors and may require medication as part of their treatment plan."

Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of despair and a desire to eliminate any remaining hope. This suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, as well as a lack of belief in the possibility of happiness.

"Post: To keep things short I hate my life and wished I could kill myself but i cant. I'm 21, both parents dead, no family support, just friends, my brother abandoned me and left me out in the cold and kicked me out and cut me off because I was out drinking as a teenager. I just got a dui and possession of pot that wasn't mine but a kid left in my car. I'm on my own, and put myself thru a auto school and I'm barely doing that. I'm just lost in life, no one. Barely making it by myself and just screwed my life up. Luckily I have the money for a lawyer. But now I'm at rhe point where I hate. I just want to kill myself and think about it. But I can't do it cause I'm a pansy. I guess there's something stopping me. It's not easy and I've dealt with a lot for a 21 year old.

"Post: Just the idea of being able to leave this reality and just be drunk alone at home is comforting, not needing to care or be there. What is even more depressing is that I care about being of age to do this, and being able to just do it alone. Not to follow a cliche on this subreddit but does anyone else feel this way? Just wanting to hide away in being inebriated.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none.

"Post: Always when laying awake late at night. Moments of existential nihilism and realism. Realizing how shitty the whole concept of life is. And just any kind of realistic negatively in general.

Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of existential nihilism, realism, and negativity. The poster reflects on the concept of life and expresses a negative perception of their personal life and self as a failure.

This alienation likely contributes to mental disorders in the post."
"Post: I went through a major depression and experienced a breakdown of sorts. Threw away a lot of awesome opportunities. While I'm back in control of my life (sort of), I feel like I damaged my reputation beyond repair, am mortifyingly embarrassed by my actions, and now feel so behind in life. Now I feel like I'm existing on the fringes of society, and if I don't change something soon, I'm going to be ""exiled"" to live a life of isolation, depression, and irrelevance.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing a major depression and a breakdown, as well as feeling embarrassed and damaged reputation. These feelings of isolation, depression, and fear of being exiled suggest that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's relationships with others and how they perceive themselves in society."

Post: I don’t want to go back to school this week. It’s hard being alone at school. It’s hard finding a place to sit at lunch or where to chill in the morning. Its hard doing group or partner work when you don’t have friends in any of your classes. It’s hard to get over a breakup when your dad doesn’t let you go out to stay busy with your barely existing friends. It’s hard when you stay at home and try to talk to your ex when you know the conversation is going to end quickly. It’s hard when you crave your ex’s company just to not feel so alone but you know it’s impossible. It’s hard knowing your friends/peers are doing just fine with you isolating yourself. It’s hard  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling alone at school and struggling to find a place to fit in, as well as difficulties with group or partner work due to not having friends in their classes. The post also mentions a breakup and wanting to stay busy with friends, but being restricted by their father. This indicates that the poster's mental disorders are likely related to their experiences and feelings of isolation and difficulty in their school environment.

"Post: Hey reddit So i've decided to get myself tested for depression. Ever since i was about 13,14 (am 21 now) i've had these feeling of dread and just haven't been happy with myself. I have talked about these feeling recently with some of my mates and they all think i do have depression this also includes my EX who has tried to get me to go doctors for the last 2 years.

"Post: and i know they all know it's today. I wished my """"""best friend"""""" of ten years a happy birthday a few days ago but clearly i misjudged how many people ever even think of me. and it isn't just this, i feel like if i never made an effort to talk to any of them they would just continue to ignore me  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels ignored and unimportant in their social circle. They mention wishing their best friend a happy birthday but feeling like they are not thought of by others. The statement ""if I never made an effort to talk to any of them they would just continue to ignore me"" implies a sense of alienation and a lack of meaningful connections with others. This feeling of being ignored and unacknowledged by their friends contributes to a sense of alienation and potentially leads to mental disorders."
"Post: So many problems would be solved. So many desires would be fullfilled. I don't even want to be rich, but not having to worry about money would be wonderful. Everyday I wake up and think about the things I am not allowed to have or experience because I'm poor. Everyday I think about the things other people take for granted, that I don't have. Everyday I think about the moments I tried to get out of this hole, only to be shot down by things completely beyond my control. Everyday I break more and more. When will this almost infinite vortex of suffering end?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post emphasizes the poster's feelings of being limited and excluded due to their financial situation. They express a sense of frustration and hopelessness, as well as a constant awareness of the things they cannot have or experience because of their poverty.

But bones must break. And souls of evil Mine are to take I am the Night I am Vengeance I Am Batman  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not mention any specific factors that could contribute to mental disorders such as bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others.

"Post: Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self. I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post discusses a series of events that have caused the poster to lose friends and feel disconnected from others. They mention a health issue that resulted in losing friends in high school, feeling upset and bitter about their high school experience, and struggling to connect with new people in college.

"Post: I’m starting to see 2018 on tweets or images from the other side of the globe, and it’s filling me with unspeakable dread, something like I’m leaving a stove on in 2017. Like I wasted this year or I’m not ready for 2018?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels a sense of disconnection and dread towards the upcoming year. They mention seeing tweets and images from the other side of the globe, which could imply a feeling of being left out or not fitting in with the excitement and anticipation of the new year.

"Post: Not in a literal context but I really do feel like I'm regaining my life from someone else's control after a decade of numbing myself from meaningful social interaction. I never talked to others, I've never flirted with a woman, I don't know how to read people, and I gave everyone the idea that I want to be left alone. Now the real me wants to shine but I don't know how to do it and no one wants to give me a second chance. It's as if I was spreading a rumor about myself. I feel like my decisions were already made and I'm locked in a contract I can't get out of.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post indicates a sense of isolation and lack of social interaction for the past decade. The poster mentions not knowing how to read people, not having flirted with women, and giving off the impression that they want to be left alone. They express a desire to break free from this isolating pattern but feel like they are trapped and unable to do so. This sense of being locked in a contract they can't get out of and feeling like their decisions have already been made further emphasizes the theme of alienation and disconnection from others."

"Post: So I was married for 8 years, got cheated on the whole time. I pretty much knew it but didn't do anything about it cuz how do you really make someone stop. I tell myself I stayed for the kids but really I think it was just so I didn't have to crawl back to my family. With her I have 1 kid. She had one when I got with her. Then some how we got guardianship of another. But legally I think I'm only reasonable for the 1. I dunno. But anyway we have been separated for a few years now. I still live with her for the same reason. Still married to her unfortunately. Wish I had the money for the divorce. So I sleep in the living room while she is with another guy. That doesn't bother me at all. She cheated on me though that I didn't even care when we decided to split up for good. I can't get a job right now cuz when I try to she does something to make sure I have to watch the kids instead. Like leave town for 4 days. Her boyfriend refuses to watch them. So I'm such at the house. I barely talk to my family cuz of some issues we had a few years ago. Read my posts and you will know. So they won't help me out. I never get time to myself and when I tell her I want to get out of the house she pretty much threatens to kick me out and take the phone back they I'm using. So i rarely get to go anywhere. I wish I was dead most the time. I take a bunch of pills sometimes to try and end it, but then I feel bad cuz of the kids. But I think they would be better off without me being depressed around them all the time. I don't really know what to do anymore. And I'm sure I will get negative comments cuz I'm the only one taking care of the kids, but whatever. I don't care anymore.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a long history of infidelity in the poster's marriage, as well as the emotional toll it has taken on them. They also discuss their current living arrangements, where they still live with their ex-spouse who is with another person. This indicates ongoing relationship distress and a lack of resolution or closure in their separation. The poster also mentions barriers to finding employment due to the responsibilities of taking care of the kids, which may contribute to feelings of frustration and helplessness. The post concludes with expressing thoughts of suicide and feeling like their children would be better off without them, suggesting severe emotional distress related to their relationship and life circumstances."
"Post: Hello everyone, I'm new to reddit so I'm not quite sure how it works but I felt I needed a platform to discuss this so here goes. I'm 17 I live in Sheffield, England and for the past few months I have have been dealing with depression and it is tearing me apart LISA (love you if you get that reference). In all seriousness, I feel so disconnected from everyone around me and it scares me to death. My 'friends' are all busy with relationships or with their own friend groups which is a thing I've never been apart of, I've always just had friends who had friend groups so I would be in a weird position. I often have very self loathing style thoughts and have very little to no self esteem. I feel like my friends are using me in a sense that they only call me if they need help with college work or I'm the last option because the rest of their friends were busy. I can't do anything though because I don't want to risk losing the few friends I do have. They all come to me with the stories of the great nights out or the holidays they all have planned and when they ask what I was up to, which is rare, I just have to say ""nothing"" and it makes me so deflated. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months and that is due to the lonliness, I would get back out there and look for someone but I have no confidence in myself so I'm terrified to do so. I can't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because they shouldn't have to put up with it which makes writing it here a bit ironic but oh well. In summary I'm scared. I'm scared of what the future holds, what happened in the past and I'm scared of the present and I'm not expecting any sympathy or world class uplifting guidance I just needed a place to vent. So if you managed to read through all of this then thank you for letting me vent. You are a truly great person.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

"Post: what’s the point? why even try? all that i learned from this mess called “life” is that there is no point in trying, life gets harder and harder every single day to lead up to what? more hard work and stress to get us to nothing in the end. we humans work our asses off 24/7 for fucking jackshit. excuse me for my profanity here but i’m being serious, what actually is the point of this torturous cycle called “life”? all i’m willing to do right now is jump off an overpass because i can’t do it all over again...

"Post: I usually lurk for awhile, but this feels safe enough. Truth is, I’ve know for decades that I lost the Genetic Brain Chemistry Lottery. In other words, I’ve been self-medicating nightly for 3 or 4 decades, a moderate to heavy drinker. Odd situations: I worked in a field that drug tested me every 3 months, performed a polygraph every year, and would pull you clearance if they found out you were on anti-psychotics because you were a security risk. But it was fine to keep a bottle in your desk. They finally experienced “Enlightenment” a couple of years back, but old habits die hard for us old hands. So, after six months of getting the brain chemistry stable (a lot of trial and error in that business). The snakes have been on me long enough. Time to take the depression and anxiety seriously.

"Post: I walked in on my first day of high school a depressed kid. i made some friends, they showed me that life is more than just moping around and working to get a diploma to mope and work more. They are the best people Ive met in my life so far and i would protect them with my life. i care for them a lot and would do anything for them. That was 3 years ago, and of course, im still a depressed kid with friends. However, i think about killing myself on a weekly basis, and openly say that i hate myself to a lot of people. it has become common practice to say these things, like a shield to desensitize me and other people from mortality and the worse of the world. I also secretly hope that this softens the blow if i ever decide to jump off that overpass in my area. I want my friends, family, and everyone im connected with to remain happy and normal, so i put on that fake smile and pretend that nothing is wrong aside from the therapy that doesnt work. i value other people's happiness more than mine (for reasons that would make this post too long) so i keep on smiling and repress emotions until i walk into my room and shut the door. everyone i am connected with doesnt know im suicidal, i dont want them to worry about me, just to remain happy. and if i kill myself they would worry and get sad too, like me right now. i am living for other people because i dont want them to know the truth. i am a prisoner of other people. i just want to know what the hell am i supposed to do, and that im not alone in this world tl,dr: i made friends in high school and started to care about people in my life. but im depressed and dont want anyone to know that im mentally ill and suicidal because i want them to stay happy and not worry about me. so i live with a false smile on my face, and keep my emotions to myself. what the heck am i supposed to do?

I have no inclination to go out and ""meet people"" I just want to go home after work or on my days off/weekends and do nothing then feel like crap for not meeting people which starts the cycle of self loathing over and over again. Sometimes I think of hurting myself, or killing myself. the one thing that stops me is knowing that it would only hurt my family, and my clients. I work a lot and love my jobs (work with special needs individuals) and i will not do that to them. if did not have my jobs and my clients who love me i would do something but i do n0t.

"Post: I’m 15 and I have zero friends. Nobody reaches out to me and i’m not romantically pursued. I’ve literally threatened suicide multiple times (for attention) and not a single person asked me if I was okay. All I have left is daydreaming and I just am not present anymore which is shitty because my exams are coming up and I have no motivation or capability to revise due to my lack of acceptance of the present. I just want to know what i’m doing wrong with people for myself to be completely invisible. I feel incredibly isolated and I just want to feel alive.

"Post: I'm graduating from college this year, and I'm not ready. I study character technical direction at an art school, and my portfolio is not where it needs to be for job opportunities. I've already taken all the classes on that subject, so now I'll be spread too thin to work on side projects for my demo reel. My goal was to spend this break working on projects, improving, and learning. I spent plenty of time working on it, but I haven't been improving much.

Post: Quick background... 4 year relationship ended about two months ago. Madly depressed because of it. Irresponsible of me to say that I was not taking my antidepressants until recently.

"Post: I have been depressed for several years. Currently taking Lexapro, though it seems to not help. I have no will to succeed in life. I've never had a job for more than a year. I failed all 12 credit hours in community college last semester and I don't want to go back. I hate my parents and I'm not close to anyone in my family. At this point, I just want to spend the rest of my life in my room, unemployed. I'll receive an inheritance if I'm lucky. My mom gets up early everyday to go to her job where she's been for 20 years. I know I have some major depression issues, but there are lazy bums in this world, who are unemployed and live at home until they're 40, or forever, and I think maybe I'm just one of those bums, regardless of depression.

"Post: Depressed again because I realized I've been a horrible friend to whom I've been emotionally attached. My mind summoned every negative aspect of my personality and rubbed it in my face. Suddenly I have no desire to do anything. Shut myself from social media, don't want to game, to study (and I'm a top student so this sucks double), to do chores, or do anything. I know what I should be doing: start progressing and stop brooding, but I can't find it in me to snap out of this. I have no energy for anything. Suicidal thoughts come and go although I have no energy to deliberately kill myself, but I'm praying for my accidental death. I'm on school vacation and by the time I return to my classes, everyone would notice this change in my behavior and performance. How can I return to my normal life? P.S. Seeing a therapist is not an option. I don't have a job and my family can offer no help.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

"Post: I have been isolated for most of my life. Every possible action I could take to improve my life has been rendered meaningless by previous attempts at averting the disaster that will be my future. I feel like I am doomed forever and that nobody will love me. It's too late. I am way too far behind to catch up with the normal crowd. I have zero friends and literally no family to turn to in times of desperate need. I have tried talking to doctors and therapists and that never worked either. Whenever I bring up my problems, they say I am ""indulging in self pity"" or they treat me like I am blaming other people for my misery. What am I supposed to do when my whole life has sucked and on top of that, my depression is getting worse? It hurts whenever people try to take the situation and blame it on me, when they don't know me. Fuck them. I don't know the point of this post. But, one thing I am certain about is that I am ready to die. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to turn around my life. I don't know how to find love and I doubt anyone will love me (and if you are going to tell me it's too early to kill myself, then let me tell you that for most people, it comes naturally without any hard work whatsoever. I, however, am miserable because I am a fuck up. An aberration. An anomaly). Thank you for reading this garbage and good night.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

The poster mentions being far behind and having zero friends and no family to turn to.

"Post: I wanna ask you because for some time now I've been trying to be less cynical and do stuff other people like but I just cannot understand why are they doing all of this? I hate facebook , I hate memes ,I hate internet culture and it annoys me to see people embracing it and not even being able to make a normal conversation just talk about memes on the internet , stupid youtube videos and shows that they binge watch in a day and don't have any valueable opinion on it just saying that they liked it or not . Am I just a cynical cunt ? PS: By the way I'm posting this qustion here because this stuff is quite a big reason of my lolieness and depression , you know I just can't find anybody to connect with and it's not like I automaticly cross the person off for liking this stuff , I'm trying to get to know them and it turns out that they're just a frankenstein of all the popculture they absorbed and they cannot hold a conversation even for a little while.

"Post: Just got played at work. Girl. Same old same old. I have another job. It's only part time. Just built up from homelessness after staying with a friend to a hotel.

"Post: I fell for my best girl friend/ best friend and she is the only happiness I feel. Whenever I am doing something with her, texting, sitting next to her, thinking about her I feel genuinely happy. Games have basically ceased to exist in my happiness radar. However, she is also one of the reasons I am depressed. I heard her tell me ""I love you"" and I love her too, but my depression prioritizes everything in my mind, even my feelings for her so half the time she is the only hope I have and the other half she becomes this endless pit and I fall deeper and deeper. My life has been put into shambles because of this stupid mind game my brain put on itself.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's romantic feelings for their best friend and how being with her brings them happiness.

"Post: People die from these subzero temperatures every day in the U.S., it's so malicious and sad. Every morning is a dark, freezing piece of shit with awful drivers ruining the roads. It saps what little life energy I have left just thinking about it. I fucking loathe winter because it makes everything in my life inconceivably difficult and adversarial. Driving a frozen-windshield car, commuting to my icy-road job, buying food, even taking a shower are all mountainous, painful ordeals. Every moment is spent desperately not freezing to death. I never want to leave my room, talk to anyone, or do anything because it all requires unreal pain and effort. Fuck winter and all it comes with. Had to get the truth off my frozen fingertips, go to Hell.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

These feelings and reactions suggest that the poster's mental disorders may be related to their relationship with winter and the negative impact it has on their daily life."
"Post: I'm 21 years old and a complete and utter disappointment to those around me. I dropped out of high school in grade 10, I couldn't do it anymore every day the pressures of school and a teacher who graded me differently than everyone else caused me to be physically ill. Every single day I'd use a friends phone and call my mom sobbing to come pick me up. I was out of school more than I was at school at the point juggling my mental illness and fighting extreme stomach issues that ended up being gastroparesis. Dropping out feels like the worst decision of my life. My family treats me like I'm faking all my issues in order to get out of my responsibilities. When in reality I've been fighting as hard as I can. Juggling financing myself through my art, being homeless, and the crushing weight of my illnesses. Everyone seems mad at me. My psych office has me on probation for missing too many appointments. If I keep missing them I'll be kicked out and left without my medication. I've been clean from self harm for probably 8 months but lately when I look at my scars all I can think about is doing it again. I don't have time to go inpatient and the suicidal thoughts keep getting worse. I have people who love and support me but I still feel like I'm letting them all down. I don't know if my family will accept me because of my transition. I haven't told anyone but a few but I'm positive my older brother outed me to everyone and I'm too afraid to face them now. Im not ashamed of being trans but I am afraid of losing the last of my family. I can't hold a job because of my PTSD. I can't keep friends because I don't think I'm good enough for them and my BPD just makes it harder to connect to people. I'm avoidant as fuck and all I want to do is shed all my mental illnesses and not have to feel this way anymore. I've failed trying to kill myself. I've failed academically. I've failed friends. I've failed my therapist. I've failed myself. What's left when nothing you do is good enough?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a sense of disappointment and feeling like a failure to those around them. They describe struggling with mental illness, difficulties in school, and a lack of support from their family. The post also mentions being transgender and fearing rejection from their family because of their transition. These experiences contribute to a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, leading to mental disorders such as depression and suicidal thoughts. The feeling of not being good enough and constantly failing further reinforces the sense of alienation."
"Post: I wanted to make this year a great one, but that won't happen. I'm in a household where every time i try to better myself, someone or something ruins it. I've gotten very bad anxiety/depression the last few weeks but if i try to talk to my family about it they either make it a competition or write it off. I want to get better at drawing but i can't draw for a half hour for what i get interrupted. And i want to draw for three hours each day but that won't happen. I'm wanting to lose weight but my family lives off of fast food and snacks. I want to do so much, but then my depressing thoughts of death and horrible memories catch up with me and i realize my reality is shit. The only thing keeping me here is the idea of getting away and being happy. I feel so lonely, lost, scared and confused. There's so much dwelling in me right now and this is just 1% of it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions multiple instances where the poster's attempts to improve themselves are being hindered by their family. They describe feeling anxiety and depression, as well as a sense of frustration and hopelessness. They mention wanting to engage in activities like drawing and losing weight, but feel unable to do so due to the environment created by their family's habits and lack of support. The post also mentions feeling lonely, lost, scared, and confused, indicating a lack of emotional support and connection. All of these factors suggest that relationship issues and a lack of support from family are the cause of the mental disorders discussed in the post."
"Post: I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. For a while now, I've felt like being kind of crazy is what makes me who I am and without these feelings and behaviors, I wouldn't be me anymore. During the summer I quit taking my medications and going to therapy because I thought it was a waste of time and that it was just a way for people to control who I am. Even on meds I still felt sad and wished that I could just die quietly all the time. I stopped taking them cold turkey and withdrawals hurt like hell, but I felt like the medications that had been poisoning my mind and changing me irreparably would finally be gone. I stopped going to therapy for the same reason. The meds hadn’t been working, but my attitude about my situation led me to spend the last six months in a really dark place and I wasn't able to study, eat much, or do basic things like get out of bed or take a shower. I kept feeding into my suicidal and self critical thoughts. At the same time, I kept thinking that I was just fake sick and the real sufferers have Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and that I was just all bent out of shape about a minor mental illness that millions of people cope with easily every day. This made me want to be sicker so that I could feel more special or like I had more inside me to be expressed. I guess I was wondering two things: first, I was wondering if anyone else felt like they needed their mental illness to have worth and fed into it like I did/do and second, if anyone felt like struggling with depression makes them weak because there are worse mental illnesses. If anyone made it this far, thank you.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions multiple mental disorders (depression, anxiety, and ADHD) that the poster believes make them who they are. However, they also mention quitting medications and therapy because they believed it was a way for others to control them. This indicates a sense of alienation and mistrust towards treatment options for their mental illnesses. 

Furthermore, the poster mentions feeling like their mental illnesses are not as significant as others with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. This suggests a sense of comparison and a desire to have a more ""serious"" mental illness in order to feel special or valid. This sense of alienation and self-doubt contributes to their mental disorders, as they struggle with feelings of worthlessness and weakness."
Post: I have really bad anxiety to the point where I feel like throwing up. Does anyone know how to build confidence or get over it  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest any specific causes for the anxiety experienced by the poster. It simply asks for advice on building confidence or overcoming anxiety. Without more information, it is not possible to determine the cause of the mental disorder."
"Post: I've had suicidal thoughts from a very young age and have never felt able to tell anybody about them because, realistically, there's no reason I should be depressed. So many people have it so much worse than I do and it makes me feel like my emotions are invalid, and that if I were to actually acknowledge them to someone else it would seem like I'm being dramatic and attention-seeking. At this point I wish I could just give my life to someone else who actually has it bad because it feels like I'm wasting it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling suicidal and having depressive thoughts from a young age. The poster also expresses a sense of invalidation and feeling like their emotions are not valid because they believe others have it worse. They mention feeling like they are wasting their life and wishing they could give it to someone who actually has it bad. These thoughts and feelings suggest a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, as well as a lack of support or understanding from those around them. This sense of alienation contributes to their mental disorders."
"Post: I'm just gonna leave it here so I can come back to it later. If you look for help this won't help you, after all I can't help anyone. I see no solution to this problem. It's not like I can't feel anything, that's not it. It's more like every emotion I feel is flat and fake. I can be happy but it is an empty happiness. I can be sad but it doesn't last long before I force myself to feel happy again. I can control it. I can control my happiness. I force myself to laugh and have fun and I feel the dopamine rush. Deep down, however, I feel like in the long run it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what the goal of life is but it's not to be happy. Not for me at least. I would love to feel empathy again. I miss it. No matter how hard I try, I can't feel it. It's like I have become immune to it. I have one male friend who knows everything about me. I believe I'm not homosexual but I think about him a lot recently. It feels like he is someone who I would be able to feel affection towards. Even this would be better than nothing, I suppose. I don't know what to think about all of this, I hope I'm not losing my mind.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling disconnected from emotions and experiencing flat and fake emotions. The poster also expresses a desire for empathy and mentions thinking about a male friend and feeling affection towards him. This suggests a longing for emotional connection and romantic or intimate relationships. The post also mentions feeling unsure about their state of mind, indicating a possible impact on mental health. Therefore, the assigned label for the cause of the mental disorders in this post is relationship."
"Post: Here it is, I've blocked out any personal information here cause I don't want someone stalking me or knowing it's me. Hello, I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me. I have a high IQ, and am about to major in psychiatry myself. Please contact me here or my number is **********. Regards, **** ****** I know I was coming off desperate at the end but I am. I'm severely depressed but I don't want to be! I don't want to be like this anymore. It's been too many years of this abuse and I cannot bear it with how bad the depression has deteriorated my brain. If anyone wants to talk about this more, please feel free to dm me. I am on another account then my main one cause I don't want anyone recognizing me or friends knowing I posted this. EDIT: I am not from India.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of depression that was neglected for years, indicating a preexisting mental health issue. It also discusses living with an abusive father and experiencing physical abuse, along with mentioning the intention to major in psychiatry and having a high IQ. Although the post does not directly mention jobs and career as a contributing factor, the mention of neglect and abuse in the family suggests a dysfunctional family dynamic that may have contributed to the poster's mental health struggles. Additionally, the mention of wanting to study psychiatry suggests a personal interest and potential career path related to mental health. Therefore, jobs and career can be seen as a possible contributing factor to the mental disorders in this post, as the dysfunctional family dynamic and the interest in studying mental health indicate a potential connection."
Post: I cannot see myself in a few months time.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: There is not enough information in the post to confidently assign a cause for the mental disorder. The statement ""I cannot see myself in a few months time"" could suggest a sense of hopelessness, which may be related to feelings of alienation or a lack of connection with others. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact cause."
Post: I feel really fucking depressed and it just keeps getting worse I literally feel like life is fucking me over every chance it gets. Like any time something bad can happen it will and it's just breaking me down more and more for years now. It's literally starting to feel like any happiness I could ever have will never be enough to help me get over all the fucked up things life has done to me and it literally make me want to stop living. Why should I live when every day it feels like life wants me dead. What should I do?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of depression and hopelessness, suggesting that the individual feels isolated and disconnected from others. They believe that life constantly brings them down and that happiness will never be enough to overcome the negative experiences they have had. This sense of alienation from others and the world is likely contributing to their mental disorders, leading them to question the purpose of living."

"Post: I attempted suicide by hanging, my mom found me and saved my life. I stayed in the psychiatric unit of a hospital for a week. I'm on new meds, I still don't feel any different, I really don't know what to do. Does this ever change? I'm in my early 20's. Anyone here turn things around after an attempted suicide?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions a recent suicide attempt, followed by a week-long stay in a psychiatric unit and being put on new medication. The poster expresses that they still do not feel any different and are unsure of what to do next.

"Post: Why is it the two worst, most hurtful relationships lasted years, while the ones that feel that they have the most love and promise a real future fall apart in an eye blink. I feel cursed to either live in misery, or except fleeting happiness, followed by loneliness. What a joke. I really fucking hate my life.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the pattern of having long, hurtful relationships, while the ones that seem promising quickly end. This suggests that the poster has experienced multiple failed relationships and feelings of misery and loneliness as a result.

"Post: I was looking soo foward to 2018, I was happy. Now I have nothing to look forward too.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling happy and looking forward to 2018 initially, but then expresses a sense of hopelessness and having nothing to look forward to. This suggests a feeling of disconnection and alienation, as if the poster is lacking a sense of purpose or something to strive for. This feeling of not having anything to look forward to can contribute to mental disorders and a decline in overall well-being."
"Post: Guys I've been so depressed lately, but I have so much shit to do in my life rn. I really really need some suggestions for (healthy) coping mechanisms to just get through the day.

"Post: With severe anxiety and body dysmorphia it's extremely hard for me to connect socially, though being more social is something I wanted to do this year. Well, today my only prospect for being more social completely dissolved. A new friend of mine asked me some 10 days ago if I would like to attend dancing courses with her, and I thought that would be a great way to be more social. Then today she wrote me that she won't attend the dancing courses with me out of consideration for her boyfriend. Yes, be considerate of your boyfriend, who cares about ugly useless me. It's like Fate telling me: ""Don't even bother trying. You're too ugly to be with anyone else. You think a new year changes anything? You're going to be alone forever, get used to it!""  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior."

"Post: I feel like I have been stuck inside this deep hole for years now. I am 15 years old and I feel like I have experienced way more than I should have at this age. I don’t ask help from my parents nor do I tell them about my problems because they will simply just say “Get over it. That’s nothing.” I find no purpose in anything anymore, I don’t see the point in improving myself, I just simply don’t find any purpose in living life anymore. I want a GF because I think that having someone to love, someone to comfort and generally someone to just look forward to seeing again will help me out of this hole, and show me that I am not alone and there is someone who will love me back. I tried to get a GF, but each time it has ended the same way, with me being shoved away and them not wanting me. It is ripping me apart mentally. I have given so much to others thinking I would be given the same amount of love back, but that isn’t the case. I just want one thing, someone to love because then I know I am not going to be alone for the rest of my life because right now all I think about everyday is the fact that I am alone in all of this. If I can’t even have that then what can I have? None of my friends can truly sympathise with me because they simply haven’t experienced my pain on this level. I’m not sure if anyone in the world have experienced what I have. This feeling of loneliness and hopelessness is just killing me inside. I wish I can just quit now and leave early because I don’t want to see this game out to the rest of what it has to offer.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling stuck in a deep hole and experiencing more than they should at their age. They also mention not seeking help or support from their parents, implying a strained or unsupportive relationship with them. The poster expresses a lack of purpose and a desire for a romantic partner to provide love, comfort, and companionship. They mention trying to find a girlfriend but experiencing repeated rejection, which is causing mental distress. The post highlights feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, and a desire to end their life, indicating that the cause of their mental disorders is related to relationship issues and a lack of support from loved ones."
"Post: I want to die, but I love my boyfriend with all my heart. He's the only person in my life who has shown me what it is to just love someone. He's the only part of being alive that I like. My job sucks. My family sucks and without him I would have killed myself a year ago. I still don't want to live, and my functioning is going downhill fast. I want to figure out how to want this life. I want the desire to be present because it's not just me anymore, but I don't know where or how to start. How do I escape this pain?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a strong attachment and love for their boyfriend, but also expresses a desire to die and a lack of desire to continue living. The poster mentions disliking their job and having a negative relationship with their family. They express a need to escape the pain they are feeling and a desire to figure out how to want to live. This suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection, as well as a lack of support or fulfillment in their life outside of their relationship. The cause of their mental disorders is likely related to their feelings of alienation and a lack of support from other aspects of their life."
Post: And honestly I've been by myself for so long I don't even know how abouts I would even begin interacting with other people beyond superficial niceties.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling isolated and unsure about how to interact with others, suggesting a lack of social relationships and potential difficulty in forming or maintaining meaningful connections with others. This sense of social isolation and inability to navigate social interactions can contribute to mental disorders, making the relationship an assigned label in this case."
"Post: Idk whether it's related to this sub's theme or not but I feel so exhausted because of this disguisting habit. I'm lying everyone even about my favorite colour, not to mention about my current mental condition. Why am I doing this?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a pattern of deception and dishonesty in the poster's interactions with others, including lying about their favorite color and their current mental condition. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder may be related to relationships, as they are likely experiencing a fear of judgment or rejection from others and feel the need to hide or falsify aspects of themselves. This can lead to exhaustion and mental distress."
"Post: I have never been diagnosed with depression, although my girlfriend has. She frequently has periods of extremely low moods that can go on for days or even weeks, and has attempted suicide in the past. Whenever I see her like this it eats me apart from the inside with guilt, because I feel like it's my responsibility to help her and make her feel better and when I can't I feel like shit. I feel like a failure whenever this happens and I don't know what to do. Does anyone here know what to do? Or how to help? I hate watching this happen to her and I feel so guilty.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's girlfriend having periods of extreme low moods and a history of attempted suicide. The poster expresses guilt and a sense of responsibility for her well-being, indicating a deep emotional connection to her struggles.

"Post: It's so difficult when someone asks me what my hobbies/interests are. I can't just say 'staying home and sleeping all the time' or 'watching hours of YouTube' or something. I wish I could say I still have hobbies but I just don't. Sometimes I like to say 'I like going out to eat' but that's a lie because I try my hardest not to. I've always been the kind of person to just put on a front around other people and laugh and try to say what a normal person would say. I hate that I'm doing nothing with my life, but it's difficult to be determined when emotionally you just don't have the will to. Do you feel the same? What motivates you to change?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions difficulties in identifying hobbies and interests, as well as feeling like they are ""doing nothing with my life."" This suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from their own desires and passions, as well as a lack of motivation or will to make changes. The post also expresses a desire to present themselves as a ""normal person"" and put on a front, indicating a lack of authenticity and a feeling of being disconnected from their true self. These factors contribute to a sense of alienation and likely play a role in the development of mental disorders."
"Post: I'm not visiting a therapist for 10 years and have to take heave medication everyday. I haven't been in a war and had a friend die in my arms. I'm not a homeless, heavy drug addict. It's like today everyone is depressed. I don't want anyone to believe that i'm just some person trying to get attention or be a stereotype. For me life is hell but i know that there is a person that has it worse. But for me my problems are obviously the worst thing but... I dunno. I'm not worth that. A lot of shit happened to me, many stuff i don't even know exactly anymore because all i did my whole life is try to suppress it all to the point that i have no idea who i am anymore. I now i'm not normal but at the same time i feel like i'm not ""worth"" being called depressed or something. I'm just stuck between life and time with no where to turn to and not a goddamn clue what i am or what i'm allowed to be. There is no end and i can't even tell where i belong to. It's like i'm stuck in a tiny, tiny hole and i can barely breath. Can't even type this without thinking to myself ""Just get over it, you're just stupid and not entitled to this. Just stop."" I hate everything.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that the poster has been taking heavy medication every day for 10 years, suggesting that medication is a significant factor in their mental disorders. They also discuss suppressing their experiences and feeling stuck, indicating that they may be experiencing trauma or unresolved issues that require medication to manage their symptoms. The post also mentions feeling not ""worth"" being called depressed, which could indicate a belief that medication is not warranted or effective for their mental health."
"Post: Since about halfway through the current school year I've been extremely apathetic towards most activities, and have found the only source of entertainment in music and going to the gym. I've lost most of my appetite and have no desire to do most things at this point. Many video games I used to play just feel so dead and lacking of fun. Am I depressed, or am I just feeling low?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling apathetic towards most activities and losing interest in things that used to be enjoyable. This suggests a sense of disconnect and lack of fulfillment, which aligns with the cause of mental disorders related to alienation. The poster's question about whether they are depressed or just feeling low further supports this, as depression often involves feelings of disconnection and a lack of interest or enjoyment in activities."
Post: It's been 9 months and I have been battling depression and I'm giving up on the fight. I don't know how to make myself feel better. I hope one of you knows the answer  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post mentions battling depression for 9 months but does not provide any specific information about the cause of the depression. Therefore, it is unclear what factors may be contributing to the poster's mental disorder, and no specific cause can be assigned."
"Post: I have a lot (self-diagnosed, albeit) signs that lead to the dreaded D word. Not sure if it's because of external influences, or some chemical imbalance. I only find relief in meditation and sleep. I'm afraid to read others posts from fear of empathizing and manifesting their feelings in my life and not getting a sincere gist of my own situation and feelings. Are there any tips someone could give to someone who seems manic and apathetic at the same time? Is there anyone I can talk to who may understand what it is I'm feeling? Are these feelings even real?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post suggests that the individual is experiencing symptoms that could be associated with a mental disorder, but does not provide any clear indications of the cause. They mention self-diagnosed signs and potential external influences or chemical imbalances, but do not provide any specific details or experiences that would point to a specific cause such as bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication side effects, relationship issues, or alienation. Therefore, the assigned label is ""None"" as the cause of the mental disorder is not evident from the post."
"Post: Hey. Excuse my incoming rant, I just feel like I have to get a few things off my chest or they will crush me for good and I have never done this before. Also excuse my English - I am prone to not paying attention to the grammar when I get long-winded. What a year this was. Well, not for me but for pretty much everyone else I know. Success just can't stop coming for them. Pretty much everyone is doing great, even the people about which I used to think that they would end up in my current situation. And then there is me, in all of my useless, depressed self, wallowing in my self-inflicted misery. The only things that were enjoyable to me happened on a macro scale so they didn't really affect my personal actual situation at all. I'm 24, still living with my parents and lonelier than ever before. I spend most of my days at home, mostly reading and watching useless crap on the internet. I read books too, but not as many as I used to. I've got attention issues. 10 years ago I could tear through a 600 pages long book in a day, today I can barely go for 15 minutes before I feel like I have to do something else (like refreshing a webpage and seeing that nothing has happened) and then have a hard time coming back to whatever I was doing. I can still read fast but I feel like I've become addicted to the ever-avaiable constant stream of shallow information that is so typical for this day and age - I think I know more the American electoral system now than I have ever wanted to know even though I live half a world away. Still, I've read pretty much through the entire Western canon over the last few years, trying to find answers... to anything with nothing coming out of it. I procrastinate... a lot. It causes issues at the uni where I have been behind on pretty much every deadline I've ever gotten and considering what I've been told about my latest paper I may not even be able to finish it. But the degree I am trying to get is useless anyway (I chose it a few years ago in a bout of depression after I quit my original pursuit of some economics degree), so it probably doesn't matter anyway. The worst thing is that I think that I actually have a good work ethic when I really set my mind to something, but I hardly ever actually get to that point and I have a hard time staying in it because my mind just goes somewhere else. I've tried to write a book - I think I am pretty good with words, at least in my native language, and I thought it would offer me some more opportunities for escapism (that's pretty much the only peace I get these days). I got really excited, spend 3 weeks on it... and yet once I stopped some 30k words in, I have been having a hard time getting back, even though I have the whole thing in my head. Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems. A doc told me two or three years ago that I should see a specialist because my thyroid apparently isn't working exactly as it should. I've ignored that advice and now I fear going to see a doctor because they will shit on me for neglecting the issue. I think it's just an irrational fear of criticism and denial. I know that I should do it and yet I can't bring myself to it. I've been delaying and delaying, always putting it in the ""after that"" spot. I am an idiot. Telling myself that I am an idiot does not really help though. I've got communication issues too. Had them for a long time. I was bullied a bit at school when I was like 12 but while I thought for a longest time that it didn't affect me (I've become friends with all those people overtime), it probably ended up affecting me more than I thought it would. It certainly put a dent into my school performance, even though that was probably paired with the fact that I did not have learn anything for my first 6-7 years at school because all that stuff was too easy for me and so I never really learned how to learn, if you know what I mean. The worst thing is that I feel like there is no reason for me to not live a normal life. I am clever... heck, my intelligence is well above average according to everything I have ever been told. I look normal - I think I have a pretty face, pretty green eyes and nice  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions several issues that suggest a need for medication. Firstly, the poster mentions attention issues and difficulty with concentration, which may benefit from medication to improve focus. They also mention procrastination and difficulty with completing tasks, which may be helped by medication to increase motivation and productivity. The post also references thyroid problems, which may require medication to regulate thyroid function. Additionally, the post mentions communication issues and a history of being bullied, suggesting that medication could potentially help address any underlying mental health conditions such as social anxiety or low self-esteem. Overall, medication appears to be a relevant factor in addressing the mental health concerns mentioned in the post."
"Post: I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time. About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better. It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me. Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling). The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again. I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"". This feels like a really hopeless situation for me currently, but I wanted to write this to see if anybody has had something similar happened to them before, and how to dealt with it?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's experience with medication for depression, specifically Prozac, and how it had negative effects instead of helping. They also mention trying to seek therapy but facing a long waiting list with no response. This indicates a sense of alienation and hopelessness in their mental health care journey, as they haven't found effective treatment options and have been let down by the healthcare system. Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to feelings of alienation and lack of adequate support."
"Post: I play on Playstation. The only friends I felt I’m actually close to (save 2/3 people at my school) are on Playstation. I hinted yesterday that I’m feeling down and made a few depression jokes etc. And they passed it off as me “going through an edgy phase”. Afterwards the two calling me an edgy teen left until it was me and my closest friend online. He asks if I’m depressed shortly after the other 2 leave. I tell him everything. He isn’t the first person I told, (1 of the previously mentioned school friends was the first) but he confesses to me that he knows how I feel, and that he self harmed for about a month of his life. I was shocked. I didn’t know what to say. I guess know I kind of admire him for getting over it and going through it. I’m scared to tell anyone else. I have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, I feel unmotivated and can’t get to sleep. I also usually can’t get out of bed in the morning. I am too scared to kill myself but I wish I could just die in an accident. I wish there was an easy way to cope with it or beat it but there isn’t. I feel like I’m the only one apart from previously mentioned friend that’s going through with it in my area. I guess when I go back to school the fake smile will have to fool everyone all over again.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a sense of isolation and disconnection from others, particularly in the context of their friends on Playstation. They express feeling down and making depression jokes, which were dismissed by their friends as just going through an ""edgy phase."" The poster then shares their feelings of depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and difficulties with motivation and sleep. They mention admiring their friend who self-harmed and got through it, indicating a sense of connection to someone who has gone through similar experiences. The post also mentions feeling like they are the only one in their area going through these struggles, further highlighting their sense of alienation. Therefore, the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's feelings of alienation and isolation from others."
"Post: In my case it's my family and especially my mother who tell me that they can't deal with me and that they don't feel good either, which just gets me down even more. On the other side everybody wants to talk to me and connect me with people they know who are feeling or who have felt the same way and it's just extrem annoying.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's family, specifically their mother, expressing difficulties in dealing with them and how this brings them down even more. It also mentions being annoyed by others trying to connect them with people who have similar experiences. These interactions and the dynamic with their family suggest that the cause of their mental disorders is related to relationships, particularly with their family."
"Post: So i'm visiting another city with my friends, i knew upfront most of them would be couples and us single folks would be in minority, but what the hell, right? And at first, it went along well but now, two days in and i'm getting that feeling, like two people are making out violently next to you? Yeah, kinda like that. I also overhead someone say ""but anon is the only single person here, which i didn't really want spelled out to everyone. The only thing i'm thinking of right now is this and if maybe there's a bus that leaves for my city soon and jump on it without telling anyone. So i don't want to do now, other than eat and drink myself to sleep, with the others. I'm not bitching that ""waah, give gf now, waah"", it's just that I don't like being made fun of for this reason. So what, i'm single, i'm socially inept, and i'm depressed. That's me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling uncomfortable and singled out due to being the only single person in a group of couples. They mention feeling like they are being made fun of and feeling socially inept and depressed. This suggests that the poster may be experiencing bias or abuse from others in the group, as they feel singled out and mocked for their relationship status."
"Post: When i lived in the states, i had no healthcare so if i wanted anti depressants and counselling, i had to pay out of pocket. i was 15 when i was diagnosed. my mom was working overtime to support me and my two younger siblings, there was no way she could afford mental health help on her own and she made that clear to me. Now that i live in kenya the mental health resources are even more strained and the stigma is worse for seeking them. when i try to talk to people about how i'm feeling they either make me feel worse or tell me they're sorry cause they don't know what to say. and why should they? none of them are licensed therapists. i'm at a point where i need intense professional help but can't get it so my best bet is to do whatever makes me feel better, no matter how harmful it actually is.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions the lack of access to mental health resources and the stigma surrounding mental health in the poster's current location, Kenya. They also express frustration with the lack of support and understanding from others when they try to talk about their feelings. This sense of alienation and lack of access to professional help is likely contributing to their mental disorders and the harmful coping mechanisms they mention."
"Post: I'm starting to think about it a lot. I have no skills, I have no hobbies and I've never been happy with any job. I was happy with her for three years and she told me she loved me like no other then five months later is dating some other guy, I saw a photo of them together before the new years. She was probably just using me, she most likely cheated on me multiple times - certainly once since she gave me chlamydia. I loved her so much I had never felt so safe and happy or secure in my life until I was with her and I believed she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet or had ever met. I was kicked out of school young and I lost all my friends with that. I have been trying so hard for this past year to put myself out there and meet people but got no where. I feel so alone. I feel so sad. I am starting to lose confidence that I would never actually end my life I've thought about it since I was a child and always told myself I would never actually do it, life is full of possibilities but death is death. I don't care about possibilities any more and death is sounding more and more like relief and peace of this emptiness.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post describes a series of relationship-related issues that are likely contributing to the poster's mental health struggles. They mention a breakup with a person who they loved and felt safe with, but who ended up dating someone else shortly after. They also mention suspicions of infidelity and being infected with a sexually transmitted infection by their ex-partner. The post reveals a deep sense of loneliness and sadness, as well as a loss of self-confidence. The poster expresses thoughts of suicide, indicating the severity of their emotional distress. Therefore, it is clear that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to relationship difficulties."
"Post: I thought that once I came back. That people would talk to me, that I'd be part of a group. That never happened so I feel so betrayed, like I put in so much work into myself over break to better myself and now you still won't talk to me. In reality, it was futile to begin with. Nobody would ever talk to me, I'm isolated beyond recovery. I'm destined to remain lonely.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses a feeling of betrayal and isolation, suggesting that the poster feels excluded and disconnected from others. They mention putting effort into improving themselves over a break, perhaps in the hope of being accepted by others or forming connections, but feel that their attempts were futile. This sense of being destined to remain lonely indicates a deep feeling of alienation, which is likely contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: Somebody I care very much for has been on escitalopram for years due to crippling depression. He had been taking 10mg every night for years but about 2 months ago he started taking 20mg every night (2 of the 10mg tabs). His doctor said this was fine and last month he filled a prescription for the 20mg tablets which he's been taking since. Now, for the past week and a half, he's been feeling very emotional and out of control and the past 3 or 4 days he just can't stop crying, even at work. Every little thing upsets him to the point of tears and when he talks, he almost sounds like he's drunk. Of course, him being so emotional, he won't go to the doctor because he feels like it would be wasting the doctor's time. I was just curious if anybody here has had this happen or heard of this happening? Either with dose increases or changing strength of the actual tablet?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions someone the poster cares about who has been taking an increased dose of medication for depression. The poster describes the emotional and out-of-control behavior exhibited by this person, including excessive crying and slurred speech. The post also mentions the person's reluctance to seek medical help due to feeling like it would be a waste of time. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the relationship between the poster and the person they care about, as well as the potential side effects or changes in medication."
"Post: Nothing but social anxiety and depression. Can't talk to my parents, let alone a doctor. Can't even talk to my counselor. No friends and I spend my time playing video games. Guess what, today I got banned for being a toxic fucking scum. Also, the only living thing that I could be myself around was taken away from me last week, my dog. Can never see her again. Literally feel like my life was taken away from me. Don't even know how to sleep at night without knowing she's with me. I don't have the grades for any university, and community college will be a waste of time. I don't think I even have the ability to succeed in a trade school, cause even there, you need social skills to become an apprentice in your trade. So I can't even become a plumber or a garbage man. I'm thinking about the army to man myself up, but Ill never have the fucking balls. This vent can go on and on and fucking on, but I'll stop here. I hate my life.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of social anxiety and depression and difficulty in talking to parents, a doctor, and a counselor. The poster also mentions not having friends and spending their time playing video games, suggesting a lack of social connection and alienation. They also express a sense of loss and despair over the recent death of their dog. The mention of feeling incapable of succeeding in school or trade school due to social skills further emphasizes their sense of alienation and disconnection from others. Overall, the post indicates that the cause of mental disorders for the poster is likely the feeling of alienation and lack of social support."
"Post: I feel lonely because it's another NYE and it just reminds me that I've gone another year without finding anyone to connect with, share life with. Nobody to share stupid resolutions that we'll break with. Nobody to say ""happy New years!"" at midnight to. I feel like 2018 is just going to be another repeat of work, school, sleep, eat, again... and that I won't make any meaningful connection with anyone, won't achieve my goal of completing a degree, and it won't be any different from the last 5 years. I realize that this is probably part of my depression kicking in, but I'm really sad I haven't even got a friend to chat with tonight.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling lonely and a lack of meaningful connections with others. The poster expresses disappointment in not having someone to spend New Year's Eve with and a general sense of sadness about their lack of friends. They also mention their depression, which likely exacerbates their feelings of isolation and contributes to their mental disorder. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is related to the poster's relationship issues and feelings of loneliness."
"Post: I don't think I've typed here much.. but it's probably going to be my second or third time. Many years ago I was into a long distance relationship that started with a solid friendship in 2010. After years this guy from Mexico left and I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either. He replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. I think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid. I don't think I'll get anyone else in probably years since I only had two relationships (both long distance ones) and I had to wait like 3 years for the next one to happen. (the last one I had) I think I am doomed to die alone. I don't know what to do, I feel so much anxiety. I want to stop feeling things, I'm a failure at these things. I'm horrible with relationships and I wish there was a way for me not to feel anything anymore. Please help.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's experiences with long distance relationships and the impact it has had on their mental well-being. They mention feeling alone and crying themselves to sleep after their first long distance relationship ended, leading to trust issues. They then describe the challenges they faced in their second long distance relationship, including arguments, feeling demanding, and their partner eventually leaving them for someone else. This caused the poster to feel devastated and question their worth, leading to anxiety and a desire to stop feeling emotions altogether. It is clear that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the difficulties and turmoil experienced in their past and current relationships."

"Post: Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression! I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room. However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health. I would be much grateful if you guys can recommend any books you think would be of great help to a person fighting mental illness. Tks for reading and sharing!  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions multiple physical health conditions (IBS, sleep paralysis, bone fractures) that have required surgeries and the use of antibiotics and painkillers. The post also mentions feeling like the most unfortunate person and suffering from depression as a result. The use of medications and the impact they have on the symptoms suggest that medication may be a contributing factor to the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
"Post: EDIT: Wow that many upvotes and support, thank you to everyone who has commented here, it has helped me, happy new year I have been born in a terrible part of a bad country in south east Europe, I suffer from depression, social anxiety, severe OCD, (I can't get help for any of my mental illnesses) I suffer waking up, and suffer even more when going to sleep, I am slightly overweight, get bad grades at school, am socially awkward as hell, get bullied, feel poor, my family has been damaged by the communist system, I feel guilty and worthless, I have a toothache and will probably have to go to the dentist about it, doing that in the part of the world where I live in is what I genuinely think is brutal torture, have anger issues, been feeling numb lately, I can't help but mindlessly envy people who have honestly had it way easier than me in life as they revel in their lives, cake walking through their days as I suffer... and I get that the image that they have painted of themselves through social media is not accurate, the internet has lowered my self esteem by making me feel left behind and inadequate because it made me feel like I am here suffering, feeling guilty and worthless while others are having a blast in their perfect lives, (one of the most memorable things that made me compare myself to someone was a tweet by jesse cox saying things along the lines of how he gets to do all these cool things because he is a popular youtuber and how he is having an amazing time of the year, ""having the biggest joys of his life"") I have piles of homework that I have trouble starting because I know it will be painful, I feel inferior to everyone else in my class and I have no idea how they push themselves to do the painful ass work required to get good grades, I am jealous of others in my class, I can't bring myself to workout, I stutter, I feel lazy and unproductive but can't have that pain bring me to do work, I think I am causing my parents depression, my voice sounds like absolute garbage, and cringey + high pitched when I speak in English, I keep feeling tired...

"Post: I question my purpose daily. Will I ever find the ""one"" for me? This spiral of emotions I deal with on a daily basis has me emotionally numb if that makes any sense. It's noticable in day to day conversation. Praying for better days  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions questioning one's purpose and a desire to find a romantic partner, indicating a sense of disconnection and alienation from others. The poster also mentions feeling emotionally numb and seeking improvement through prayer, further suggesting a lack of emotional connection and a sense of isolation.

"Post: All day today I've been shaking and my anxiety has been through the roof. I spent my day in bed crying and throwing up. Nothing brought on this panic attack, I've just been awfully down.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing high levels of anxiety and having a panic attack for no apparent reason. They also mention spending the day in bed crying and feeling down. This suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection from others, as the post states that nothing brought on the panic attack.

"Post: For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long. For the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December. At the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole. I tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home. The mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily. These feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasn’t necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time. Fall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I “blew up” often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldn’t feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parent’s situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside. (READ LIST) ------------------- *Ups:* **High energy** * Shaky * Hard to stay still * Lack of need for sleep * Pacing Example: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasn’t. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer. **Paranoia** * Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends * Believing others to be plotting against me in some form * (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down * Thoughts of people trying to kill me * Government surveillance * Loss of trust in those close to me Example: On the way to the airport in December my mother, sister, grandparents and aunts split up in different taxis. My mother received a ride from her married friend. (This friend also has children.) My mom came a bit later than us, as she got lost. However I strangely acted out in paranoia, accusing her of having an affair with the man, accusing her of cheating on my d  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: It's about other things too, but depression is a big part of it. The thing is that I've got it about 80% done, over more than a month ago. And now it's just kinda sitting there, unfinished. &amp;nbsp; I have tried to ""finish"" it, but it's just too difficult. Trying to finish the video just proves itself to be too much of a task. So I am just going to put it out as it is. &amp;nbsp; Do you guys also experience this? You start with something, and at first you are excited. But then when you are almost done you just loose the will to go forward. &amp;nbsp; Anyway, I am going to post a link here as soon as I have it uploaded. It's going to be a really good video, so I hope some of you guys would like to watch it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and struggling to finish a video. The poster mentions starting with excitement but losing the will to go forward when they are almost done. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder may be related to their job or career, as they are experiencing difficulty completing a task and feeling a lack of motivation in their work."
"Post: I was just curious as to what medication/mg are you on? Has it helped you? what other meds have you tried? I'm currently on Effexor XR 300mg, and it has helped me so much!!! but if I don't take my medication at the same time everyday I feel so sick, horrible brain zaps to where I cant even move my head/eyes.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post directly mentions the poster's current medication (Effexor XR 300mg) and how it has been helpful to them. They also mention experiencing physical symptoms, such as brain zaps, when they do not take their medication at the same time every day. This indicates that the mental disorders mentioned in the post are likely related to medication and its side effects."
"Post: I can either stay at home and drink wit my parents friends which will be shit or I can ride my bike about 4 hours to get to the city where my friends live. Part of that ride includes going over a fucking mountain. Plus, just took a ritalin pill so I'll be fucked after the ride.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions taking a Ritalin pill, indicating that the poster is taking medication. They also mention that they will be ""fucked"" after the ride, suggesting that they may be experiencing negative side effects or a reaction to the medication. Therefore, the cause of their mental disorders in this post is likely related to the medication they are taking."
"Post: I honestly feel empty all of the time. I'm super insecure and I don't really love my family, which I feel a little bad about, but I just don't. I've had to move my entire life so I don't really have any friends so I just sit in the dark all day. I really hate school, not because I'm not smart or anything, but I just have to go and see people who actually have friends/people who care about them. I go to a Catholic school and I don't believe in god so every time they pray I feel like laughing at them which just illustrates how awful I really am. I want to transfer to public school but I know I wouldn't be able to make any friends there anyway. I always have to sit with the foreign exchange students who can't even speak English (I'm american) because they are the only people who tolerate me. I think about suicide all the time but I know I probably won't kill myself because it won't change the fact that I live a completely meaningless life and Ill just fade into the void after I die. I really don't see why anyone would try to become friends with me because I have super shitty social skills, which I happened to inherit from my parents. I've been to a psychologist and it really didn't help. I have one person who I can really talk to but I want to not have to because I feel like I'm just dragging her down with me whenever I talk about how much I hate my life. The only thing that makes me feel a remote amount of happiness is money, and I honestly could care less if I lived or died at this point. I just needed to get this out because the person I've been talking to is probably getting tired of hearing it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling empty and insecure, not loving their family, and having to move frequently, which suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from others. They express a dislike for school because it reminds them of other people with friends and support systems, and they mention feeling like an outsider at their Catholic school due to their lack of belief in God. The post also mentions suicidal thoughts and a belief that their life is meaningless. The mention of wanting to transfer to a public school and the difficulty in making friends there indicates that social isolation and a lack of a support network may be contributing to their mental disorders."

"Post: Maybe this post belongs in r/anxiety; I'm not quite sure. I do know that lately I've had this feeling that, on several occasions, has made me quite literally sick to my stomach. It's very hard to describe. See, I recently turned 18. I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life. I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve? I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve. Thank you for taking the time.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post describes feeling overwhelmed, bored, and directionless in their academic and career pursuits. They mention graduating high school with a low GPA and feeling that nothing is happening when they are at school. They express a desire to go to college but feel it may not be the best option for them at the moment. They also mention the fear of taking a year off and ending up in dead-end jobs. This indicates that their mental disorders are likely caused by the stress and uncertainty surrounding their academic and career choices, making jobs and career the most suitable label for this post."
Post: I have this habit of writing poetry to write how I feel - and it seems like this one might be appreciated here: https://mkbenigma.com/2017/12/30/loner-bar-anthem/  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none.

Post: Like seriously I can just be driving and I'll have a breakdown and start crying. On Friday I was cleaning at work and I was getting really frustrated because I was extremely tired. I was trying so hard not to cry. Then I came home very angry and had a really bad outburst at my boyfriend. Like for real what is wrong with me?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"medication. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing breakdowns and crying while driving, as well as having a bad outburst at their boyfriend. These emotional fluctuations and outbursts could be symptoms of a mental disorder. The post also mentions feeling frustrated and extremely tired, which could indicate that their emotions and behavior are being affected by medication or medication-related side effects. The poster expresses confusion about their behavior and asks what is wrong with them, suggesting that they suspect the cause may be medication-related. Therefore, the assigned label for this post is Medication."
"Post: I'm really depressed. There's no one here to help me or to force me to get up. I've been in bed for a few days, only getting up to go to the toilet and refill my water. I haven't had any energy to make food so I've not eaten in 4 days. Just water. This is a particularly bad period, but even when it's better, it's still tough. I was randomly googling things like ""how to survive when you're depressed"" and one of the common pieces of advice is to be kind to yourself and accept that you're not operating at your normal capacity. The problem is, if I'm operating only on 20% capacity, what do I do when my life is demanding at least 60%. I have so many things I haven't done. I missed a doctor's appointment yesterday, I ignored a friend's invitation today, my credit card is due to be paid in a week and even though I have the money to pay it, I just haven't yet. My fridge is completely empty aside from food that is two weeks bad. I haven't showered in 5 days. I have a massive laundry pile to do. None of these things are unmanageable on their own, but there's just so much that I feel I can't do. How can I even begin to get help when I'm this bad? It feels like I've already reached my limit just refilling my water and going to bed. How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself? The guides online say to recognise the small achievements. What do you do when staying in bed and not killing yourself is an achievement? It might be admirable from some perspectives, but the world doesn't stop for chronically ill people.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and being isolated without anyone to help or support them. They describe being in bed for days, not eating or taking care of themselves, and feeling overwhelmed by basic tasks. They also express thoughts of suicide and a lack of motivation or energy to do anything beyond basic survival. This sense of isolation, lack of support, and feeling overwhelmed by the demands of life suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to a sense of alienation and disconnection from others."
"Post: Finally went to the doc after being in a nine month low, the lowest I've been in years. I started meds and my doc just upped them after my three week check up. She also gave me a pill to stop panic attacks. I thought I was making strides forward. Today my dad's girlfriend, a very nice and loving woman, died. She died the exact same way my mom died almost exactly six years later. I remained calm for him, but I'm having a terribly hard time. I'm just numb. I just don't fucking understand. Death just follows me. I don't know what to do. My boss told me to take tomorrow off. My dad lives 3 hours away and is snowed in so I can't really even go visit him. I'm drowning.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's recent visit to the doctor for a nine-month low and their subsequent prescription of medication. They also mention the doctor increasing the dosage and providing a pill to manage panic attacks. The post then discusses the death of the father's girlfriend and the poster's struggles in dealing with grief and feeling numb. This suggests that the mental disorders in this post are related to the poster's medication and the emotional response to the recent loss.
Post: I'm not afraid anymore. Fuck this world and everything in it. I'm getting no where. I have the noose tied.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong sense of anger and frustration towards the world, as well as a desire to end their life. The use of profanity and the mention of tying a noose indicates a deep level of despair and isolation. The phrase ""getting no where"" suggests a sense of alienation and a lack of purpose or fulfillment in life. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is likely alienation and a feeling of disconnection from the world."
"Post: I have extremely high standards when it comes to soulmates and partners, in fact, I've such high standards, me being 20 years old I never had a girlfriend, and yes, I am extremely good with people; I can tell almost immediately who's who just by looking at them and conversing for a few minutes, and no, I'm not socially awkward, nor do I have social anxiety. A few days ago I saw perhaps the most perfect, and the absolute ideal soulmate in a video on youtube I've ever seen in my lifetime, and no she isn't super-famous or super-rich or anything, she's a starter youtuber. If you know a thing called ""internal checklist"" that you have for the perfect partner to fit under, appearances, personal traits, perhaps manners, the way they dress, their ""own world"" etc, not only was mine fully filled, it also has extras, AND she's single. Sadly, this isn't a story with a happy ending. She has a social anxiety, I've no way to get in touch with her, nor would I want to make her uncomfortable by being a random creep who follows her around, does research on emails /contact info etc, I'm not thinking about myself in this case because she purposefully hid her email address from youtube as well as contact info and I won't try to obtain it. I did try to look her up on facebook, and she hid everything from public, hence proving that it'll just make her even more uncomfortable if some random unknown freak sends her a random email to an address that shouldn't've been discoverable by public. This glass effect is SO bloody painful; I can see her, I hear her talk, yet she will never know about my existence, we will never meet, and never look at one another in real life, ever. It is new year's eve today, and I literally just feel like going back into my maths [I'm studying compsci] and not getting out of the world of mathematics for the next 3 months, I feel HORRIBLE, just so damn empty, tired, somewhat broken, especially when I realize that such people (for me I mean) probably will come up once every 20 years, judging by my past years. Obviously not suicidal, but my fucking god, I've never felt such a strong soul pain. I know it might sound cringy, and I'm sorry about that, I've just never felt this pain before. And if this is love at first sight, why in oblivion is it glorified so much? This pain is just so damn unbearable, especially knowing that I may, perhaps either end up being alone because such people are **ridiculously** rare, or marry someone just for financial stability, which most likely won't be the case for me; money means nothing if there are no feelings. Anyways, thank you for reading this long ramble, I'll try my best to recover and just, sort of move on, although I know that periodically I'll probably get dragged back to this person. *sigh*  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post expresses intense feelings of pain, emptiness, and longing related to a person the poster perceives as their ideal soulmate. They mention internal checklists for the perfect partner and feeling that this person meets all the criteria. They also discuss their inability to reach out to this person due to their concern about making them uncomfortable or being seen as a random creep. This unrequited love and the resulting feelings of emptiness and yearning are likely the cause of the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
Post: Came to cry and reminisce. And think of all the lives I could've touched if I wasn't depressed...  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels disconnected from others and believes that their depression is preventing them from making a positive impact on others. They express a sense of regret and longing for the ability to touch lives and suggests a lack of fulfillment and a feeling of being isolated from others. This sense of alienation and disconnection is likely causing the mental disorders mentioned in the post.
"Post: Back in August I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication. I'm overall in a much better place than I was beforehand, but I feel myself slipping back. I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. Since I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline. I doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway. I think it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore. At the peak, I could go hours, sometimes a day or two, without a thought about killing myself. Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing. I don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck. So, yeah. Is that possible? For medication you've been on for less than 6 months to just stop?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: When the poster says ""I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication,"" it suggests that they have been struggling with mental health issues. They mention being in a better place after starting therapy and medication but then describe themselves slipping back into dangerous thoughts and self-loathing. They also mention having a decline over the past month and a half and feeling like the medication is not working as well anymore. This suggests a sense of alienation and frustration with the medication not providing the desired results, contributing to the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
"Post: I’ve been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and I’m finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasn’t really helped. I also asked him for sleeping pills and they didn’t help either. In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I don’t remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them. Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant it’s like I wasn’t really asleep. Physically I’m well rested but mentally I’m not. Idk if that makes sense but I feel like I’m going crazy because in my dreams I sometimes “wake up” and think everything is normal but then previous events from the dream come back and it’s so confusing. Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and it’s messed up. I told my doc and he said most of the antidepressants have similar side effects and that’s kinda made me miserable. I don’t wanna trade my sanity just to stop being depressed. I’m honestly thinking about stopping meds again. Idk anymore.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing lucid dreams as a side effect of medication and the distress and confusion it causes. The poster also mentions feeling mentally drained and that going to sleep is no longer a comfort. The doctor's suggestion to take medication in the morning instead of at night and the unsuccessful attempt to use sleeping pills indicate ongoing struggles with medication and its side effects. The post also mentions feeling miserable and considering stopping medication altogether due to the negative impact on their mental well-being. These experiences suggest that the cause of mental disorders in this post is likely related to the bias or abuse experienced through medication side effects and the negative effects it has on the poster's overall mental health.

Post: I need the confidence I have when I’m drunk. I’m just a better person and not a little bitch I need help why can’t I just remove the insecurities from my life and just live my life please just help me.

"Post: A bit of background: I've been struggling for 5 years with severe depression and I'm currently in my 3rd year of college. My main drive in life has been to eventually get a job over-seas (mainly anything involving national security or humanitarian aide) to help people around the world however I can. Currently studying Political Science with a minor on International Relations and have plans to continue through law-school. Thing is, I'm getting really restless along the way. I have a future job in mind that only requires a bachelor's degree but I'm afraid that a degree on Political Science won't really get me anywhere in the long run so I should have a law degree to back it up just in case things don't go as planned. I've also considered going on student exchanges but due to economic problems in my family, we've had to prioritize our expenses on other necessities. I live in Puerto Rico so we've also had to deal with the aftermath of hurricane Maria; university's been delayed for months so any chances for internships clashed with the semester's new schedule. Due to all of this, I haven't been able to fulfill that desire to travel. I feel like there's so much going on around the world and the fact that I'm stuck for a couple more years buried in lectures is killing my motivation. I've tried to distract myself through different hobbies, volunteer work and going out with friends but nothing's genuinely helping. Don't wanna drop out of college at all but I'm finding the road ahead really tedious. I'd like to hear how any of you have dealt with a similar kind of rut and how I could maybe find that drive again to not let my grades go down cause of my depression. Thanks for reading and happy new year  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors related to the poster's career and educational goals that are causing them to feel restless and lose motivation. They express a desire to work overseas in national security or humanitarian aid but express concern that their Political Science degree may not be sufficient. They also mention economic problems in their family, which have prevented them from participating in student exchanges or internships. Additionally, they mention feeling stuck in lectures and finding the road ahead tedious, which indicates a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in their current educational path. These career-related stressors and concerns are likely contributing to the poster's experience of depression and loss of motivation. Therefore, the assigned label is jobs and career."
Post: She randomly blocked me on all social media we message each other on. She was the only reason I kept going every day. Now I've wasted days in bed. I start school again soon and all I can think about is her. I really miss her. She's probably never going to talk to me ever again. I'm nothing.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a sudden, unexplained block from someone who is described as the only reason for the poster's motivation and happiness. The poster is feeling devastated and unable to move on from this loss, indicating that the relationship and the sudden loss of it is causing significant distress and contributing to their mental disorder."
"Post: I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post describes the poster's feelings of loneliness and alienation, despite being surrounded by people. They mention struggling to connect with others, feeling like they are going through the motions of each day, and not finding fulfillment in their interactions. They also mention feeling like their attempts to interact with their roommates are not enough and feeling like they are bothering them. The post clearly indicates a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, leading to their mental disorders."
"Post: I’m 17 and my mental health is at an all time low. I think about killing myself every day, but I never go through with it because of my parents, whom I love very much. The thing is, my grades have gone from As to Ds and Fs. I can’t bring myself to do anything. I keep asking for extensions but not fulfilling them. I have no friends and I spend everyday sleeping. After a 6 year battle with depression, I want it all to be over. I’m either killing myself, or I’m fixing this by going to a mental hospital. Do I need my parents’ consent to be admitted? How long do you usually stay? And what has your experience been?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster's mental health issues are caused by bias or abuse, medication, relationship issues, alienation, or job-related stress. The main focus of the post is on the individual's struggle with depression, thoughts of suicide, and seeking help through a mental hospital."
"Post: I invited my friend Ryan to brunch yesterday since it had been a while since I saw him and I wanted to catch up. He is 16 and a junior in high school; I'm 17 and a senior in high school. Things were going great until he suggested we go hang out at my house. I drove him over and we went into my room. There was only one chair at my desk seeing as I'm usually the only one in my room so he sat on my lap - he is bi and I am gay so we're both ok with that. Then I started to go for his crotch and he told me to knock it off. I stopped for a while but then I went back in again, eventually getting all the way under his pants. A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that. It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off. What kind of person attacks their friend like that? And to top it off, I knew he had feelings for a girl at the time so i probably just fucked up their relationship. What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't normally have a high sex drive either. I feel so scared and guilty and I just want him to be OK. I don't give a shit about myself anymore. Now I understand why people self harm.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post describes a situation where the poster engages in inappropriate sexual behavior with their friend. They express confusion and guilt over their actions, indicating a disturbed relationship dynamic. The post also mentions a fear of negatively impacting their friend's relationship with someone else, further highlighting the importance of relationships in their mental state.

Reasoning: The post mentions having depression and understanding how heavy it can feel, indicating a personal experience with mental health issues. The poster offers to listen and talk to anyone who needs someone to talk to, suggesting a willingness to provide emotional support in relationships. This indicates that the cause of the mental disorder in this post is related to the poster's experiences and understanding of depression and the role of supportive relationships in managing it."
"Post: I struggled with OCD, depression, and anxiety. The SSRIs completely took away my depression, but didn't resolve my anxiety or OCD. I never took high doses of SSRIs yet, but have any of you experienced this. I found it weird that depression was the easiest to lose.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions struggling with OCD, depression, and anxiety, and specifically discusses the use of SSRIs (a type of medication commonly used to treat depression and anxiety) to manage these symptoms. The poster notes that while SSRIs helped with their depression, they did not resolve their anxiety or OCD. This suggests that medication is a contributing factor to the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
"Post: I feel like if I was my non-depressed self, I would be able to get myself out of the situation that's making me depressed.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

"Post: After being tossed aside by a few people now that I considered really close to me, it has me wondering if it’s even worth meeting new people. Like damn, I spent 7, 8, 9 years getting to know these people just to get blown off in the end. I don’t want to start over again telling people about myself, telling stories, explaining how I think, and all of those things you naturally do when you know someone for years. It’s not even just loneliness, it’s a feeling of dread knowing that you’re going to have to go through the same things that you did with the people who have hurt you to try and feel like you mean something all over again. Don’t really expect anyone to read this seriously, just felt like firing up the old depression account again.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling hurt and tossed aside by people that the poster considered close to them. They express a sense of dread and reluctance to start over again in forming new relationships, as it feels daunting to go through the process of getting to know someone and opening up about themselves.

"Post: 3 years ago I moved in with a drunk. A man who drank at least a whole bottle of vodka a day. He would do the most random crazy shit he would punch a flat screen tv countless times for no reason, beat his girlfriend and bruise her, head butt her mom and scream and yell. One time he forced us to leave with his girlfriend at 12pm in the rain and we had to walk down the road until the cops came and asked if we were okay. Things like this happened all the time. My bedroom was right under there's and I was forced to listen to them scream at each other and his girlfriend crying and screaming ,things getting thrown, her being thrown around and then having sex. I lived with them for 3 years and the final year I noticed a difference in myself. My room was kept constantly dark I would sleep all night get up and go to school and then come home and go right back to sleep when I was up all I could do is read for hours or watch tv blankly. I started to be rude to my mom and my family members. Whenever they would come in my room I would yell at them to get out (I'm pretty sure they just think I'm a cunt) before all this happend I got into a relationship with someone I didn't want to be with because I was being reckless. the last year I broke up with her (I don't even like woman either but I still dated her) I started to eat way to much and I started to stop talking. I missed a lot of school to the point where my mom was almost brought to court. I don't know if this matters but my style started to change and the music I listened to. I had no energy or motivation. At the time I didn't know I was depressed I just knew I was unhappy. Right now I have to share a room with my brother since we are staying with someone until we find our own place. The darkness comes out when I'm alone, and rn I'm constantly around someone which threw me into this state of numbness. It gave almost the complete opposite affect I can't eat I can't sleep I don't want to do anything and I'm still unhappy. I miss sleep. I want to come home and sleep so that the days will go by until we get our house. I just want to sleep forever Does anybody know anyways I can make myself sleep? Sleep is such a good pass time but I've been having trouble with it Does anyone know what to do?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions living with a person who had severe alcohol-related issues and engaged in abusive behavior towards his girlfriend. The poster was forced to witness and hear these traumatic events on a regular basis, which likely caused a significant amount of stress and trauma. They also mention feeling rude towards their family members and experiencing changes in their behavior and interests, such as being in a relationship they didn't want to be in. The post goes on to mention current difficulties with sleep and a desire to escape through sleep. These symptoms and experiences suggest that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the traumatic relationship the poster had with their roommate and the ongoing stress and trauma they are experiencing in their current living situation."
"Post: Some background information: My lowest points were 2014 and 2015. I was 15 and my family moved to another country, but it wasn't what I expected which led me to stay isolated in my apartment for three years. I was too paranoid the people I met at school would see me active on social media and ask me why I haven't been in school. Which also meant I didn't contact my friends back home for a while. When I visited home it was during the summer and we could only afford to stay two weeks. I tried to do as much as I could in those two weeks which made everything feel rushed. In 2016, my last year before moving back home, I was in a long distance relationship, it was going great in the beginning but towards the end I could tell something was different and it led me to become obsessive with his activity on social media. We broke up before I moved back home but I found out my friend, who introduced me to my ex, and him liked each other. It did hurt since he was my first boyfriend and I felt worthless and I didn't deserve love because this was the outcome. I also knew they hung out but she was my best friend and I trusted both of them 100%. I have never felt betrayal like that. I wanted support from my friend group but they weren’t there for me so I lost them as well. I am friends with another girl who is separate from that friend group and she was all I had when I moved back. When I was living away I felt so homesick but now that I was back I didn’t feel welcomed. This all happened in May of 2017. Making friends has been difficult, I notice I’ve been having trust issues and I don’t let people get close easily. But I also crave a connection with people. I also feel left out when I see people I know doing stuff without me. Sometimes I get obsessive of other people’s activity on social media and all it does is make me feel worse and I want to stop. I never felt this way before moving so I feel like these are bad habits and patterns I developed while being away. **Here are my main concerns/tl;dr: I notice myself spacing out a lot and focusing on the past rather than the present, sometimes I check where people are or what they’re doing via social media but it becomes obsessive, I don’t like that I get concerned about other people and care too much about what they think, and I feel like I focus on the negative too much.** I feel lost but I know I want to be in a better place. The solutions might be simple but my emotions are clouding my judgment. I know this was long but I appreciate any help or advice. Thank you in advance.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post describes a series of relationship-related difficulties and experiences. The poster mentions feeling isolated and paranoid after their family moved to another country, which led to staying isolated in their apartment for three years.

"Post: Exactly this day, one year ago, i was devastated from a broken relationship, i was also got laid off from my work. It was then that i decided to talk to one of my high school friend, and we continue to do that for until we became a couple. She is now my ex, she broke up with my, i'd spare you guys the detail but it's pretty much because of long distance relationship, my failure to realize it when she start to lose trust for me, and my stupidest decision ever. 2017 could have been my year, i found job at a place where the co-worker is friendly, and the boss treat me like family. I was in love someone who make me realize what it feel like to truly be in love, who can love me unconditionally. I could have it all, a good job, a wonderful family with her and my kid, yet I fucked it all up because i think too much, i worry too much about the future, about thing that may or may not happen, that i forgot about what important is in the present. I worked too hard for our future when i neglected her in the present, she began to lose trust in me, she was in pain because she think i abandoned her, and I didn't even realize it. Then she made a choice, she decided that she no longer love me and can't continue this relationship anymore. I can't get her to stay, nothing i said matter anymore, i was too blind to see that the girl i love the most was hurt be none other than me. After our broke up, i broke down mentally, i can't feel anything, can't do anything anymore. I was working two job and still in college, i tried my best to stay calm and collected when i'm study and at work. I barely pass the semester, got fired at my second job because i can't keep my mind clear, at least I still have my first job with me. Now, at the end of 2017, i was in that exact same place where i ended 2016, even worse than that. I just hope that i have the strength to go through 2018 without repeating any of that mistake, because i'm too tired of me ruining my life with my overthinking, i try so hard to control it, but i just keep doing that, and it results in me making stupid decision that keep ruining my life.

"Post: It's bad. I'm a quiet person. But now I'm realizing that the only times I'm not quiet revolve around times I'm talking about things that are depressing, like my depression or ptsd. It's like I have no sense of humor or have no personality other than that. I'm trying to build one now that I realize that, like develop interests and such, but it's a slow process and I've never ever been good at making friends. It's like, to make friends, I have to put myself out there, but when I put myself out there, I just suck at it. I am not present. I question in my mind, what do I say, does this sound stupid, and I hyper analyze my and the other persons reactions and what they say and do. It's ridiculous. I have no self esteem. I'm 27 now, just recently got approved for disability, and feel like a loser. I have a few ideas how to meet people and rebuild my life, like a local place that offers drop in support groups or meetup.com but I just feel so lost. I haven't graduated college and my boyfriend of two years just broke up with me, and my whole social support network revolved around him. I'm not used to being on my own. How can I make friends? I feel like I missed out on vital parts of life where you learn that :/  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

"Post: You always see people on reddit saying people should join a club or something, they say it so lightly, they don't have any idea what joining a sports team or something is like for someone who isn't normal. I played a sport as a teenager, if I decided to go back to the team now I would make myself physically sick with worry, so much so that it wouldn't be worth it. I never fitted into a team as a teenager so why would people think it would be any different now?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions the idea of joining a club or sports team, but the poster expresses strong anxiety and worry about doing so. They mention feeling physically sick with worry and a belief that they never fit into a team as a teenager.

"Post: I have both depression and anxiety so it may be more of an anxiety thing, it's hard for me to tell. But long story short when things get really bad for me I sometimes get really clumsy and mess up a lot. For example, today I was skiing. Now I'm a fairly competent skier and I've been skiing most of my life. I was doing fine the last couple days but today I woke up feeling really bad. I eventually pulled myself out of bed and onto the hill, but when I got there it was like I couldn't even ski anymore. I fell a lot and my legs were all wobbly. Yesterday I was doing moguls and was going as fast as I could no problem. Today I fell down on nearly flat terrain. Bent my ski pole. I also seem to have more trouble holding things (it's like gravity conspires against me too). Anyone else feel this way?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions having both depression and anxiety, indicating that the poster may be experiencing symptoms related to their mental health conditions. They specifically mention feeling bad and experiencing clumsiness and difficulty with coordination, which suggests that the cause of their mental disorders may be related to the medication they are taking for their depression and anxiety.

"Post: She said it's because our daily conversations in the past was something she deliberately attempted to adjust to because it's not her cup of tea. I don't get her. I don't get her at all. I asked her why she hadn't informed me, because I wouldn't have found out if I hadn't brought it up. She said it was an out of mind, out of sight sort of thing and she doesn't really need to tell me every single thing, that she thought I figured it out, but eventually she apologized and said that it was disrespectful of her to suddenly revert to her usual ways when she knows I'm used to the contrary. I... don't know what this all means. Am I boring? Does she not want me? Am I supposed to be mad at her? Is she worth keeping? What do you people make of this?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post reflects confusion and a sense of insecurity in the poster's relationship. They express feeling misunderstood and not knowing what their partner's actions mean. They question whether they are boring, if their partner wants them, if they should be mad at their partner, and if their partner is worth keeping.

"Post: Posted on this /r/sexuality and I want to post it here since this subreddit is more active. -- I am a male and I'm 19, I go to college. I have never been happy and content in my life, severe depression that's been on for 4+ years is one of the root causes. Depressed because I have no intimate interactions with females, who I am absolutely attracted to. Three ago I started experiencing thoughts that I would truly find happiness if I were born a female and I don't really know how I find solute in that thought - maybe because of my limited experience with women, but I do not know for sure. I lost my virginity after two days of my 18th birthday to a hooker and I didn't even get to finish. I've only hooked up with one girl when I was 17 and that included only making out and that was it, apart from those two experiences I have other sexual experience whatsoever. I need some help to understand my own self and why I feel this way, maybe it's because I need to get more experience with women? (Which is another problem.) Reddit please help  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's severe depression and dissatisfaction with their life, specifically relating it to their lack of intimate interactions with females. They also mention experiencing thoughts about finding happiness if they were born a female, indicating potential gender dysphoria.

"Post: So right now its 1 am on the first day of 2017 for me having been woken by some fools that actully celebrate such a thing with fireworks. Now I could write such grand things here like: - Every choice we make will in some way lead to pain. - The human condition is a curse. - If I have nothing to look forward to in the present or the future and there is no afterlife, what am I supposed to work towards? but the bottom line is that I feel sad and angry about how I am currently living my life and I have no intention of changing it because I don't want to or as I would rather put it to make myself feel better: - Because I see no reason to. - Because nothing will change for the better even if I try. - other stupid excuses like the ones above. So here's to a new year of all our personal hells, the only wish I have left is that I won't have the chance to say that again.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post indicates a sense of dissatisfaction and despair with life, as well as a lack of motivation to make any changes or set goals for the future.

Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of isolation and a lack of connection with others. The poet mentions people asking them why they feel the way they do, but every answer they give is a lie. This suggests that they feel misunderstood and unable to truly express themselves to others. The poem also mentions trying various suggestions to feel better, such as dressing well, sleeping well, seeing friends, and exercising, but none of these solutions seem to help. This further emphasizes the sense of alienation and disconnection from others, as the poster feels like no one understands their struggles or can offer meaningful support."

"Post: My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell. She and my father are separated. He's struggling with his own battle. I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away. I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). She's lost her white collar job about a year ago. She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go. Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape). I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse. I can't quit college to move back and take care of her. Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her. Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier. She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement. She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this. She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job. She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite). I don't know what to do. I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's mother's depression and the impact it has had on their relationship. The poster describes how their mother became dependent on them for household chores and emotional support when they were living at home. The post also mentions the mother's struggles with employment and the deterioration of her mental health, including her reclusiveness, financial issues, and lack of self-care.

"Post: I just want to start this off by saying that I've never felt better than I do now. In the past few years I've dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one. I've struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life and therefore never put any effort into anything I've done. I've been on and off three depression medications in the past and now I just recently started my third. I truly can't tell a difference when I'm on or off the medication. I don't know if I have depression or just a lack of motivation to do anything. I don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even a depression medication that can help me. My psychiatrist visits last about 5-10 minutes with her prescribing me a medication and sending me on my way. My parents really dislike her because of her medication strategy, but she's the only one in my area for 300 miles. With all that being said, She prescribed me dextroamphetamine 3 months ago alongside my depression medication and I was able to close out this college semester with a 4.0, I've been able to wake up for work everyday at 4 AM and work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day for the past 2 weeks while on break and I'm taking care of myself better than I ever have before. I feel so good, but I'm worried. I'm losing track of the pills of dextroamphetamine I'm using a day. I have to down 5 pills of melatonin a night to get sleep, I have to down 4 pills of ibuprofen every morning because I've been working my body so hard. I down 6 pills of dextroamphetamine throughout the day to keep my energy up and enjoy being at work. I'm going to become addicted, I'm going to build up too much tolerance, I won't be like this for very much longer and I'm worried. I wish I could feel energized all the time, why do I have to use medication to function. I wish I wasn't so lonely that I have to open up to reddit because I have nobody else. Why can't I be normal. Why did I even bother typing this. Why am I looking for acceptance right now. I don't even know how many pills I'm downing in a day just to accomplish a regular work day that everyone else can do normally. The answer is that it's too much.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's struggles with finding purpose and motivation in their life, as well as their history of dropping out of school and struggling with depression. They mention being on and off depression medications and not being able to tell a difference when taking them. The post also mentions the poster's psychiatrist visits being brief and focused on prescribing medication. However, the most significant factor in this post is the mention of dextroamphetamine, a medication commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and increase focus and energy. The poster describes relying on multiple pills of dextroamphetamine throughout the day to keep their energy up and enjoy work, as well as taking multiple pills of melatonin and ibuprofen to manage sleep and physical exhaustion. This reliance on medication to function in their job and sustain energy levels suggests that the cause of the mental disorder in this post is related to the poster's job and career."
"Post: I've fucked up a lot. I've ruined every part of my life possible. I've dug this hole, and hit rock bottom, and there is literally no way to fix it. I know people will say it's all fixable, but trust me, it's not. There's too many things wrong. So it's like I -need- to do it because my life will not get better, and even if I want to hang on, there's no point.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels like they have ruined every part of their life and that there is no way to fix it. They express a sense of hopelessness and a belief that their life will not improve.

Why bother, I don't seem to get further than the starting point. Fucking wasted effort, money and time.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that the poster has tried cognitive-behavioral therapy, antidepressants, and various other remedies and techniques to improve their mental health.

"Post: Hey Folks, I feel that I really need a place to vent. This past September I was accepted into a program I've always dreamed of being in which was a great win for me. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bitter sweet because my grandmother passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly after starting. It really tore me up because I had to move away in August and didn't ever call her before she passed. I guess always felt I had something higher up on the list before calling her and might have been scared to call her too so just avoided it. The next time I saw her in person she was on a ventilator and heavily sedated, a shadow of her former self. The next months I kept busy with school which kept me from dealing with this event properly. Things just got worse from there though as one of my aunts was found dead in her house (heart attack) and another underwent surgery and ended up in the ICU. I feel I buried myself in school, shutting myself out from my emotions and told myself I would work through everything when I got home for Christmas break. The first day home, however, my mom got a call saying that the aunt who had surgery took a drastic turn for the worse and was on her death bed. This takes me up to now. This aunt who meant the world to me died and I just have lost all energy to function and have shut down. I'm scared to go back to school with all of this stuff still unresolved and I just want to feel appropriately for all of these losses. I've had a few complete breakdowns this last week but the grief hangs over me still. I think this is a first step to dealing with these issues but I'd really appreciate anyone else's perspectives. Thank you  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's experiences of losing multiple family members and feeling overwhelmed by grief. They mention that they buried themselves in school to avoid dealing with their emotions and now feel scared to go back to school with unresolved issues. This suggests that the poster's mental disorders are stemming from the losses and the impact it has had on their relationships with their family members.

Reasoning: The post mentions a misunderstanding with someone the poster likes, which has led to a strained relationship. The poster expresses feeling sick and lacking direction, indicating that the state of their relationship is causing distress and potentially contributing to mental disorders."
"Post: Decided to go to my new primary care doctor in order to get a referral for my acute sleep apnea problem I’ve had since childhood. Decided because this was the first time seeing a doctor in several years, maybe I should get what is supposed to be an annual checkup(blood test, ekg, etc.). The first thing the doctor asked me was “are you feeling down lately? Are you depressed?” I kind of shrugged and laughed “ehh I don’t think so”. She smile and told me it was all part of the checkup. I told her I wasn’t feeling down, but I’m not too sure about my answer which is why I’m here. I’m going to try my best to provide all symptoms and events in order for you guys to get some idea of what I’m going through. Let’s start off with the doctor visit. Out of the blue, I started walking outside again; in the dead of winter no less. I liked to blame my tendencies to stay locked up at home on my laziness, but now I find myself taking a stroll around my neighborhood every once in a while. I never really thought I was a full blown hikikomori as I’ve maintained a job for a short period where I had to interact with customers.,. I live in a very busy part of New York so there are many faces to look at and imagine where they’re all headed. I recently applied for college as a returning student for the spring semester which is why I think it may just be anxiety or even college-mid life crisis because I am doubting my career path. I need to prep for some of the classes as I have forgotten a lot f the materials.. it’s been a good year since I’ve gone to college. I know I should be studying, but I seem to be pushing the schedule back. I even planned out my schedule on my calendar app, but I end up just deleting the notifications and telling myself that I’d do it tomorrow. I hate this part about myself because I feel this is what led me to fall so behind in school. Everyone of my peers who’ve I’ve cut contact with have already graduated and live a decent life, meanwhile I’ve quit my job as a store clerk months ago and don’t know where the time went. Activities? I stopped gaming but many people get into a period of malaise with this. I seem fill most of my day on reddit and watching shows when I’m not walking around outside. I move around the house aimlessly; idk what the deal with that is. I find myself walking into the kitchen and forgetting why I went there. I think I’m just watching what I eat. I’ve lost a couple of pounds which is great. My sleep schedule is screwed but I am not forcing myself to say in bed longer than I have to. I actually hate laying down with nothing but my thoughts because my mind drifts into odd places that make me sad. I wonder what would’ve happened if my mother didn’t have issues with the first child. That would mean I would have never been born; my parents had me because the first one didn’t take. Anyway I think about shit like that so I like to minimize my time laying in bed with nothing else but my thoughts so I end up watching shows on my tablet til I fall asleep. I’ve also never been good with sleeping near electronic devices since I was a kid. Just bad habits I think. I haven’t attempted or even fantasized about leaving here so I guess that’s good. I have written an apology letter to my parents though and I’m scared to know what the intent of that was. Well I hope it’s not depression because I’m about to get on a medication that has a known side effect that can potentially amplify the sadness. This might be a mess to read through.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions a variety of symptoms and experiences that could suggest depression, such as feelings of doubt, lack of motivation, difficulty studying, forgetfulness, aimless wandering, and thoughts about the meaning of their existence. However, the post also mentions that the poster is about to start medication for their acute sleep apnea, and they express concern about the potential side effects of the medication amplifying their sadness. It is possible that the symptoms described could be related to the poster's sleep apnea or the side effects of the medication, rather than solely being caused by depression. Therefore, the assigned label is ""Medication."""
"Post: She was abusive, and a huge contributor to my worsening depression. But for some reason I stayed with her for 5 years because she was my first. I go to bed and I can't sleep because I am just always thinking about all the bad stuff she has done to me. She didn't let me have friends, she didn't let me socialize, she GPS tracked my location and I was convinced even by her family that It was normal. I couldn't go to a fast food restaurant without her screaming over the phone telling me I'm out with a friend or I'm cheating. She changed my life for the better tho...she made me fight to better myself and my future. I wanted to start a family with her and have a home one day and give my kids a better future. All my dreams gone....I am lifeless....  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: ever since around 2010 I have been on and off with depression but for this post as its my second one I have another problem. I don't know if it qualifys to be here but I don't know where else to post it. I have for awhile had this weird thing were I separate my concious and subconscious and end up conversing with myself. I don't always agree with myself thow and sometimes contradict myself in weird ways. my subconscious will be scared but I won't be scared. that doesn't make sense. I will talk and act one way but then the next day act as if I am someone else. ussually Iignore myself but my subconscious (I nicknamed it sub so I will refere to it as that) tells me to stop. this is hard to explain so if you want to know more you can ask but for now I am going to move on. I don't think I am that good of a person, I have a strange desire ti physically and/or mentally hurt others. I try to put this at bay with things like video games and drawing (I draw alot of violence) but I still don't know why its there and it won't go away. I gett very lonely but never want to interact with others. I'm very asocial a bit more than just being introverted. I don't like telling people about my feelings because I don't like being vunlerable. I get anxiety at random times and sometimes fear for my life when I am alone for no reason. I don't feel happy nor sad but I don't know if I want to change this. I lack motivation even to do things I like.I get frustrated and angry when I make mistakes and often give up easily. I'm messing up in school, I am too lazy to do things and my mom isn't very helpful about it. I feel like a big waste of time. Sorry if this was written poorly I just typed what poped in my head as I went along.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

I can feel myself slipping away and becoming more depressed from each and every passing second, but I still have a feint voice in my mind that is saying, “You should get up and do something, even just walk around.” I haven’t had the will power to do anything; I barely care enough about getting up for work, but I am thankful that I currently won’t let myself starve or be homeless. I was forcibly admitted to the hospital twice for attempted suicide (pills, and cutting respectively) and eventually got hooked up with a sliding scale office that had therapists in the West Seattle area that got me on a biweekly visit and eventually prescribed antidepressants. Over the past three years, I have moved multiple times, to different states, and recently moved back to Washington State. I had a counselor in West Seattle that got me the recommendation for antidepressants and they seemed to work for me; but after moving around (and losing most everything I owned in the process) I am thinking I need to get back to both therapy and medication; however, I don’t remember her name or phone number. West Seattle is a long distance from where I currently live in Federal Way, but I don’t know anywhere else to turn to. Does anybody have an idea of how to find a sliding scale clinic in the area? When I google sliding scale clinics, I don’t get many, if ANY, therapists, just dentists and pediatric doctors.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of mental health issues including suicidal thoughts and attempts, as well as receiving treatment through therapy and medication. The poster also mentions experiencing multiple moves and losing belongings, which may contribute to feelings of instability and stress.

"Post: I was in acute care for a week last month and I’m looking at going somewhere for a longer term stay. Unfortunately the state I live in doesn’t have ANY residential care for my age group and if I’m going to have to go to another state then I’m going to go somewhere that I’ll enjoy at least. I realize that you can go to a mental facility in New Jersey if you live in New York, that’s simply a state line. I’m more curious to know if I lived in say, Georgia, if I could go somewhere in say, California or if that’s frowned upon. Thanks.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions being in acute care and looking for a longer-term stay in a residential care facility. The poster expresses frustration about the lack of options in their state and asks about the possibility of going somewhere they would enjoy.

"Post: How do you guys deal with this little panic you have when you meet a friend/friends that you have bad pasts with? Like, they've hurted you before, you still have to socialize with them because of group work or whatever.

But now all of a sudden i'm just cured instantly and bouncing off the walls like a dickhead.

"Post: But he wants to walk through them. It's an... oddly fascinating view I see when I look at myself outside this black bubble. I've dragged down those who are closest to me, because maybe they know, but I've never felt so grateful towards anyone for merely existing near me. I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between. Someone once read me this: ""Even the dimmest spots Would now feel bright For only in darkness Do you best see light."" Happy new year guys.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling grateful towards others for merely existing near them, indicating a sense of isolation and lack of connection with others. They also mention being in a ""vantablack-coated hellhole"" and feeling the need to escape. This suggests a sense of alienation and disconnection from the world around them, which is likely causing mental disorders. They also mention finding moments of quirky charm and appreciating things they've never cared about, which may be coping mechanisms for their feelings of alienation."
"Post: I'm going to die. Okay, I'm being dramatic, but it really feels just like that. I've already been suicidal after losing a friend recently, and it just hasn't been getting any better. I didn't sleep a wink last night even though I was so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open on the commute. And now I cannot DO ANY FUCKING WORK RIGHT NOW. I've been trying, with this half-written (more like quarter-written) essay open in front of me, to finish this stupid piece of crap once and for all. My professors are very understanding, they just told me that I can hand in a craptastic essay and they'll understand, as long as I hand in SOMETHING. And that SOMETHING is not something I can even manage to do right now. I start veering off onto other sites even if it starts causing me severe anxiety. I absolutely can't focus, and not because I have other thoughts in my head!! Why is this?? I've heard about executive dysfunction and I sincerely don't know if I have it, what's been causing it, or if I'm just a lazy ass who doesn't want to do work. It's not even work that I hate! I LIKE the work! So why can't I bring myself to DO IT??!!  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does mention feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts, as well as struggles with concentration and productivity. However, it does not explicitly suggest that relationship issues are the cause of these mental disorders. Therefore, the assigned label is ""None"" as there is no clear indication of a relationship-related cause."
"Post: I’ve been seeing the same Psych for years, however am considering switching to a psychiatrist because I’ve been on the same low dose of fluoxetine for years. I’m at my wits end and I’ve never felt more alone in my life, each night I contemplate what it would be like if I was dead. So fuck it, nothing to lose I should see a new psychiatrist even if they are expensive Do any users here have positive experiences? Did it change you at all  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication.

"Post: Today I turned 40. I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right? not at all. I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit. I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store. That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"". I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to. Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help. I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom. Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist. I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle. I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months. I've been unemployed for 2 years. I have never driven a car. I'll never have a family. I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person. I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days. Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping. I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work. It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it. If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life. I got no idea what to do. Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years? Just keep the status quo until they kick me out? Get a job at Walmart or call center? I dunno. I got to do something different. I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"". I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore. I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too. tldr; it's fine not to read it's just me babbling and mostly for myself anyhow. maybe someone else can get something out of it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions that the poster is currently taking antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist. They express uncertainty about the effectiveness of their medication and the lack of clear communication about their diagnosis. The post also discusses the poster's struggles with basic survival tasks, overeating, oversleeping, and a general lack of motivation or drive. These symptoms suggest that the mental disorders mentioned in the post are likely related to medication and the treatment for depression and OCD."
"Post: She was there, led me on, made me feel good about myself then I find out shes with another dude from work, I can’t go there without it affecting my mental health. I need to quit but I don’t have the courage, plus the money is decent. I can’t ignore them both and everytime I see her feelings come back. I’m pathetic I know but it’s the truth. I can’t take it anymore. Even when they are not there it’s a constant reminder. Please convince me to quit I need advice.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: My life feels like a sham. I am 23 years old working basically a dead end job that I have no desire to work in. My original plans were to use my undergraduate to get into professional school but I can't get into any of them so I am on the verge of giving up on those. I probably don't have any aspirations to be in the field I am in but with my parents pressuring me to go into this field, I felt as though I had no other option. I have no real hobbies other than playing mobile games, watching TV/Netflix/YouTube and eating. I have a few friends but the relationships now feel surface level. I don't know if I could muster up the courage to tell them the extent of my depression. We have discussed bits and pieces of it, but never fully in depth. While the other friendships I have are mainly just hanging out playing video games, talking about music and getting high off weed, that's about it. I find no real joy in things anymore. The activities and things I do try, only remind me of how much of a fuck up I am because of my lack of life experience. Growing up and currently I am an introvert. My family almost encouraged it becaus I feel as though they didn't know what else to do. I'm not sure how it all started if I'm being honest. It would be so bad that gatherings and social issues events where I didn't know people, I would pretend I was having nausea and hide in the washroom the whole time. Man, as I'm typing this, I'm just really ashamed at what I've become. Over the past few years I've tried to rectify these behaviors and I have seen improvements here and there (I don't hide in the bathroom anymore). However what I'm going to talk about next is probably one of the major reasons why I'm sad. So in the 23 years of my life, I've never had a real relationship before. There have been moments I go to the club or try online dating where I flirt, but that's the extent of my romantic life. Introversion feeding into my depression has basically paralyzed my mind. Everytime I want to flirt, I switch into a different mode and act shy. At the same time, I try to avoid romance for reasons I've said previous. I'm very depressed with my life and what it's come down to. I don't like the job or the field that I've been planning to do all my life. I have no real hobbies or passions outside of sitting on my ass at home, nor have I developed any real skills. They say confidence is key when approaching women, but my self-esteem is shot to rock bottom and I can never find enough courage to bring myself to ask a girl on a date. On top of that, what happens when I do ask and she says yes, where do we go from there? I have family that is Christian but over the past few years I probably align myself as b in agnostic. Because of this, I don't really mesh well with my family and their friends since I'm thinking of completely different perspective. I still live my family and I love them so much, but I realize that this is not helping my situation. All I know is that it's going to take me a long time to save up and move out somewhere. Speaking of moving out, I make terrible financial decisions. I spend money frivolously on entertainment and food. I also masturbate way too frequently which i know interferes with things such as my social and love life. I'm about 30 lbs over the ideal weight for my age and height but have no resolve or willpower to work out. I've had braces a few times and never ended up keeping the retainers so I still have crooked teeth. I feel like a fuck up every time I look into the mirror because of that. That is something I know I have to life with until I get the money to fix them myself. That's the other thing about myself. If you haven't noticed by now, a lot of things I want to start or quit, I've never been able to. My will power and resolve is also rock bottom. I've tried working out, stopping masturbating, keeping straight teeth, you name it, I've never committed to anything. I don't know what is wrong with me, I can't keep myself going for more than a week befor  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's dissatisfaction with their current job and career path, as well as their lack of passion or desire for the field they are in. They also mention feeling isolated and disconnected from their family due to differing perspectives and cultural tensions. The poster also expresses a desire for a romantic relationship and feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem when it comes to approaching and dating others. Additionally, they mention poor financial decisions, lack of willpower and commitment, and negative self-perception. These issues are likely contributing to their mental disorders and suggest that the cause is related to relationships, both familial and romantic, as well as feelings of dissatisfaction in their job and career."
Post: I deleted all social media from my phone but I always catch myself trying to check my instagram etc I know this doesnt make me happy cause i never see messages I literally have set dates when i can check back into the accounts what are some tips? This is prob a weird question but yea  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions deleting social media and feeling a desire to check it despite knowing it doesn't make them happy. They have even set specific dates to allow themselves to check back into their accounts. This suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection from others, as they are seeking social validation and connection through social media platforms. The need to constantly check and the difficulty in staying away from social media indicates a dependency on these platforms for social interaction, further reinforcing the sense of alienation."
Post: First time on antidepressants but I've been on them for 4 months now. I like the meds I'm on now and if I have an issue then I'll make an appointment with my psychiatrist is what I thought. But when I called my pharmacy they said I was out of refills. Is there any way I can just keep getting refills without having to keep visiting my Dr to renew the prescription?

Reasoning: The post mentions being on antidepressants and the frustration of having to continually visit a psychiatrist to renew the prescription. The poster expresses a desire to find a way to keep getting refills without the hassle of repeated doctor visits.

"Post: Constant fights over nothing, their psychotic breakdowns, how the always take their anger out on me, belittle me over innocent things, fight me to the point that I have to stay in hospital for 2 weeks, and always make me feel pathetic. My mom always remembers to remind me that I will end up like my uncle, who was a black sheep in his family and drank himself to death.

"Post: I am fucking depressed. I never thought that I would ever know what depression felt like back when I was happy. I never imagined that I would ever feel so sad all the fucking time, my days become a blurry mix of stress and worrying about the next day. When will I be able to look forward to something again? How do I begin to enjoy life like I did two years ago? I used to always wake up so happy to get ready for high school in junior year. I used to always look forward to the next whatever coming. Now I don't have that. I miss my old life. I don't enjoy having my own apartment, my own job, cats, and college like I thought I would. TL;DR To those who won the battle against depression, how???

"Post: Just booked some counselling sessions. I don't want to go. I don't want to try any more. Fuck it, fuck this shit. I hate feeling like this. I don't want to exist. I want to hurt myself until I don't exist any more. Yet I don't want to do that. I want to live. Oh God, I want to live. Fuck this. A fucking year ago I was in the same place. I wasn't though. I don't even fucking know. Am I crazy? What is this shit? What is this shit? I don't care, fuck it. That's like my catchphrase nowadays. Fuck it. I don't care. I'm in Hell. Is any of this even real? Is it all in my head? What the fuck. I am very upset. I don't want any more of this. What the fuck is my life. My girlfriend reckons I'm doing really well and everything is hunky dory. I don't want to tell her that it's going back to how it was. It will always go back to how it was. This is how it is. This is how it will always be. Fuck it. I don't care about me. That's what I always say. If she ever wants out I'd be fine with it. I love her to fucking bits but I want her to be happy more than I want me to be happy. That's all I want. I gotta do this fucking shit again for another year. And then for God knows how many years after that. I don't want to do it. I don't want to live. Just got off the phone with a lady from the Samaritans. Felt like a fucking idiot. I'm so stupid. Am I crazy? Is this real? I'm sorry.

"Post: I'm really into computers and gaming and shit, I have a 4k pc setup that's probably ~$3,000. 250 games, probably about 1,000 movies, 70,000 songs, nice speaker setup, studio headphones, you get the idea. I've loved this shit my entire life and in the last week I've realized that I don't even play games any more. Steam shows 0.0 hours played the last 2 weeks. I don't watch Netflix, I maybe listen to like 10 songs in a day, I used to have it on all the time. I basically just sit on Reddit refreshing the page hoping to see a news article that makes me think for .0001 seconds. I've been trying to hang out with my friends who are back in town for the holidays but I'm super fucking negative. All the stuff I would say in a conversation would be tearing down a person or an idea. My ""top 3"" friends leave today, tomorrow, and Friday. I'm gonna be stuck in a room with an entertainment system I don't even want to use. An entertainment system that I built specifically to keep me occupied because nothing else would. I thought I was drinking because I didn't care but now I realize I cared about recognizing my indifference. I really don't give a shit now. I was smoking weed whenever I got a chance. I don't even want to be high any more. I'm getting increasingly worried that my girlfriend sees me as a burden. She's the only other person I really talk to. She cares about me and goes out of her way to help me as much as she can, but you can only do that for so long, right? I feel hollow.

They mention feeling negative and tearing down others in conversations, which suggests a strained or negative dynamic in their social interactions.

"Post: This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now. I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long. I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: While the post discusses various difficulties and challenges in the poster's life, it does not mention any specific job or career-related stress or dissatisfaction. The cause of the mental disorders in this post appears to be a combination of various factors, such as financial and familial issues, social isolation, and a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness.

"Post: I am completely inlove with this man and from the beginning he has always very honest about his depression and how it has affected him etc. I just need advice from people as to how can I help him and how can I, simultaneously, be happy myself without being extremely affected by his state. Ive also realized that I’ve been limiting myself to doing things that might trigger his depression or that it will worsen it. For example, he doesn’t really like going out but I enjoy the occasional dance night with my friends or something and I feel like he dreads me going out and if I do he gets really sad. So I’ve tried to stay in, which is still fun for me,but if I ever want to go out i just don’t want to make him worse. Im very new to relating to people with depression and I would love to have some advice for people that have had a partner that has helped them with their own depression or how have you yourself dealt with a relationship like that.

"Post: Hey. If you’re reading this then...well that means I went through with what I was thinking. Then again, it was a stupid idea so if you are reading this I’ve gone insane. Now, you will not know my name because it doesn’t need to be revealed for this. Maybe someday I’ll be strong enough to face it, I mean people will find out eventually. You’re probably really confused...so I’ll just get straight to the point. I’m here to tell you my story. Usually I don’t talk about my life...actually I really don’t talk about it at all. There are certain things I’m not going to share of course, things I vowed to myself I would keep secret until death. Honestly I don’t even know why I’m doing this. I just really need to get some stuff of my chest. Life. Sucks. At least it does for me. It didn’t always..I used to be this innocent bright and cheery kid..but I guess the more I grew the more I realized how messed up society and basically the entire world is. You see, the first time I ever felt different was in 5th grade. People would make fun of me, call me stupid, tease me, call my old life weird and dumb. There were other things but I can't remember...I’ve spent 3 years learning to forget. The day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. I was sitting down taking it all in when I just broke. My shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off. Around the end of the year I started getting these awful thoughts. Regret filled my life. There were so many things that I wished I could redo and I still do. Everyday of my life I think about it and think of how stupid I was. Iwas so careless and didn’t realize that what I had done could ruin my life. Now what I did exactly won’t be shared...if anyone ever found out I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. I can barely do that now and I’m the only one who knows. Summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. They aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...I started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday. I dreaded going back to school. I had people in my class that bullied me in 5th grade. I didn’t want to go through that again. So...one night I had an idea. I was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. I ended up chickening out...but some days I wonder if it would have actually worked. Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didn’t. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didn’t even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldn’t find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually it’s what started EVERYTHING. And it’s all. my. fault. I hate myself for it. I worry about so many people I’ve met on the app. I love them all, they're great people and I’  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse.

And the one person, my best friend, who i can turn to and try to feel assurance that my fucked up life isn’t a waste, is on lockdown with her parents.

Post: Does anyone have any tips? My friend cooked some delicious bacon-wrapped chicken and I took one-bite...I smelled the left overs today and I just don't feel like eating.

"Post: I feel like a hypocrite posting here, because I've only now started actually realizing I might have depression and I might've been fighting it for some time without realizing it, but today was a horrible fucking day and it got better just now. So. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I ""overcame"" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). I didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. So yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here. What I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. But just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but the moment I press ""submit"" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes. Because I don't have to feel good to tell depression ""fuck you!"" in the face. So fuck you depression!  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster has struggled with depression for some time without realizing it. They mention feeling like they have no friends and a feeling of doom about never having friends. They also mention feeling like everyone is better than them.

"Post: I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility. But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship. I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that. I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person. I know how good my life is right now so I don't want to do anything to damage it. I don't have anyone that I am comfortable opening up to with my emotional stuff. I don't know if anyone can help me try to get my head in the right place, but I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to take control of my own feelings.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of depressive thoughts during a previous relationship and feeling trapped and unhappy during that time. They also mention self-harm as a way of coping and feeling a sense of justification and blame for their emotions during that relationship. However, they state that their current sinking feeling has nothing to do with their current partner and express fear of losing them. The poster also mentions a lack of comfort in opening up to others about their emotions, suggesting a sense of alienation and difficulty in forming emotional connections with others. This sense of alienation and lack of support may be exacerbating their mental disorders."
"Post: I went to a New Years Party last night with some people I hadn't seen in a while and I felt so out of place the whole time. Not to mention, the girl I was interested in was clearly eyeing up a far more attractive guy. I had hoped this would help me find new friends in addition to connecting with her but I feel like I failed at both. I just want someone to think I deserve to be loved but I've never felt like I should be. 2018 is already shaping up to be awful and I can't handle another year like this. I wish I could be loved, and I'm not even talking about sex here, I mean someone whom I can show them how much I care or whatever I dunno. Hugs and stuff. I feel pathetic typing this out but I don't know what to do.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses feeling out of place at a party and being interested in a girl who seems more interested in someone else, indicating feelings of rejection and insecurity in relationships. The poster also expresses a desire to be loved and to have a deep emotional connection with someone. These feelings of loneliness, rejection, and longing for love suggest that the cause of their mental disorders may be related to relationship issues."
"Post: I'm not insinuating suicide here, in any way, though I have had the thought. I'm stuck with controlling parents. Not to mention they are completely in denial about this subject. I don't trust them with ANY problems I have, big or small. I have never even been able to walk up to them and say ""hey I'm feeling down"" without it turning into a massive sprawl for outside help I don't want. Don't get me wrong, I don't want their help. It's not that I don't care about them, I just like talking to my friends a lot more. However, with parents such as these, they're constantly not allowing me to have the friends I want, do what I want, or make my own mistakes. They're keeping me trapped in an endless cycle of stress and sadness. My grades have failed because I simply can't keep up with my severe depression. But they don't get that. To them, I'm ""not trying hard enough."" And can I go to someone to vent, who I actually know and trust? No. They're a bad influence, weed smoker, etc. Not that I have a friend to run to, anyways. I mean, the only two people I even talk to are based solely on my comedic factor and emotional support(by that I support them) and so to them it seems like nothing is wrong with me. I want to be in a relationship, I do, but even at the age of 16 I've never had a girlfriend(serious, at least) and all my recent attempts have been met with rejection and then failed friendship. So I just don't know where to go. I can't keep up with grades, have no one to talk to, have given up on family, love, fashion, hobbies, school. Where am I to even go? Not to top the traumatic shit that has happened to me. I have never told anyone, even complete strangers what has happened to me, because I don't trust anyone. Depression has made me way too critical of people's ulterior motives, so trust for me is an issue. Those two friends I trust wouldn't listen to me if I had a problem anyway. Not to mention my parents keep trying to send me to therapists and the like, even though I can't tell them what I've done, for fear of getting shamed/disowned/arrested etc., and even though I've told them this they don't care. They're trying to shove help down my throat, but with good intention. So, all in all, my life is in shambles right now. I just don't know where to run. Maybe someone will read this whole thing and listen and relate, but I doubt it. Sorry if this is jumping around. I can't organize my thoughts properly right now. I'm sorry.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions several relationship-related issues that are contributing to the poster's mental disorders. They mention having controlling parents who are in denial about their issues and not being able to trust them with their problems. They express a preference for talking to friends instead of their parents and feeling trapped in a cycle of stress and sadness due to their parents' restrictions. The post also mentions feeling lonely and rejected in romantic relationships and not having anyone to talk to or rely on for support. These relationship-related stressors are likely contributing to the poster's severe depression and feelings of being lost and not knowing where to turn.
"Post: I don't know any useful information and I can't figure out new things. I'm so pissed off about how dumb I am. It's just one of the most disappointing things, out of the very many, that could happen to a person. To be a human being, practically perfection like we were created by aliens perfect, and yet to also be too dumb to interact with or do anything with other human beings.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and disappointment with oneself, specifically regarding feeling dumb and unable to interact with others.

"Post: As the topic says i hate my life, nothing is positive and everthing sucks. My so called friends lie to me, forgets about me. I recently met a woman that i connected with in a way i have never experienced. We talked about everything, both positive things and all the negative things we have experienced. She told me she have never met someone like me and that we got to know each other was ment to for both our sakes. A day ago she told me she dont want anything to do with me.. just my luck. Maybe i am not supposed to live in this world? Seems like what ever i do people just takes a shit on my life and feelings. I am so fcking tired of this happening time after time after fcking time. tl;dr: People hate me, should i stay alive?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling hated by others and experiencing repeated negative interactions with friends and romantic partners. The poster also expresses feelings of despair and questions whether they should stay alive. This suggests that their mental disorders may be caused by ongoing relationship difficulties and a lack of social support.
"Post: Does anyone actually ever beat depression? I'm not being negative, but really? Long term normality? Anyone done it? It's been about 24 months so I've had a good run! But hey! Welcome back my energy draining, Lack of sleeping, Suicidal thoughts, and over powering anxiety! It's been a while, but your back. I've had a history, not going into it, but I used to have psychotic depression at 21, with a very above average drinking habit. I have been alright though. I got a decent job, built up a solid network of good friends, I do nice things, but recency I've just been falling behind. I don't sleep anymore, keep having overpower bouts of anxiety, horrible flash backs, and if I'm being honest, recently I've been walking a different route home out of fear ill through myself off the bridge near my house.

"Post: I’ll keep this short.My parents have been working abroad since I was 6, even before that they used to work around the country so I was ‘raised’ by my grandparents(2 drunks who couldn’t give 2 shits about me).But my parents ? They have been home for about 2 months now, without a job, always nagging and yelling at me.I came to the realization that they know nothing about me, we’ re like complete strangers.They’ve missed so many important moments in my life and now it’s too late.I’m used to being alone, doing everything on my own, solving the problems I have by myself.My mom wants to ‘get’ me better now, but she treats me like I am 10.She hasn’t seen me grow and mature, barely knows anything about me.I even did well in school despite my depression, complete lack of motivation and ADD.I didn’t ask to be born into this shit, I wish I never was.

"Post: I want to help my papa, who suffers from obvious depression. He had a pretty tough life: loosing his mother when he was young, my grandfather made him drop out of high school to start working and earn money to leave in the house. He worked from 16 to 45 years. He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after. Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates. At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life. He tries really hard to look like he is ok, but he is depressed like noone I've ever seen. I can't do much by myself since im in college and haven't found a job yet. My brother has, but he prefers to take his SO in vacations. This subreddit has helped me in the past, so please give me opinions on how can I help a truly good man who has had bad luck in life.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: Hello, I don't know if other people experience this silly cycle, but I keep finding myself in my room kind of craving some kind of enjoyable social interaction but when it's offered to me I turn it down as I know I'll just be an awkward mess when I get there. So I stay in my room beating myself up at a great opportunity to feel like a normal human by going out and celebrating with old friends. Some days I can do the whole talking to people thing, it's like I don't even have to try. The words just come out and I'd like to think that I can be kind of interesting sometimes, but about 90% of the time recently I just have nothing to say to people. I want people to laugh at my jokes and I want to create deep and meaningful relationships, but as my brain just won't let me communicate with people outside of just exchanging infomation and I become a robot with nothing to say. I just came back from my family house where I can truely feel like myself without being judged and everything is in good fun. I'm open with my brothers and my parents and socially it's a great environment But now that I'm back in my student house I remember how I felt before. I can't be as open, I can't express myself and I've built a relationship with people in this house pretending to be somone I'm not just because I want to have friends so I don't feel like a total loser. I have some good times with these people, but quite often I don't enjoy the current topic or dislike the humor as they've run it into the ground with how often they make the same references or just by talking about stuff I can't relate to in the slightest. It makes me feel that I should be liking this things and I'll be an outsider if I don't. It's not like I can just go out and make new friends now anyway due to the problem noted second paragraph. The rest of my life is going well, I have a nice job, family is great and I'm starting to lose weight. But without great experiences with friends I feel like I'm still majorly missing out on what other people take for granted. I've just been offered an opportunity to go and hang out with some friends a few miles away for New Years, but with my anxiety and my socal weirdness just wants me to stay at home. I hate myself for doing it, and it's not the first time I've turned these people down because I just basically don't feel like it, but I know that If I try to go I'll just be awkward and make the experience a bit weird for everyone else there. tl;dr: I want to be a reasonably interesting person to do it, but my brain just won't let me most of the time and as a result I'm a bit of a social hermit. I want deep friendships and good times, but If I have no personality most of the time, how is that ever going to happen? I've felt like this for around 4 or 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where I'm not able to enjoy the joy of a good relationship with another human. I've not made seriously good friend since college (uk) and I feel that If I could get this sorted I could feel happy again. Sorry if this post is a bit everywhere. I have Dyspraxia and what might make sense in my head might not make sense in yours. I hope I've explained myself well enough. Happy New Year.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's desire for enjoyable social interaction and deep relationships, but also their feelings of awkwardness, difficulty communicating, and anxiety in social situations. They mention a sense of pretending and not being able to fully express themselves in their current living situation, which is causing distress and a feeling of being an outsider. The post also mentions that the rest of their life is going well, indicating that the cause of their mental disorders is likely related to their struggles in relationships rather than any other factors."
"Post: Let me explain before you claim me to be a psychopath. I have so little control over my life, I do nothing of importance, basically school and Home. My life is a repeating cycle of nothingness. But I do have a choice, a very important one. I have the choice to kill or not. That choice reminds me that I can make a difference, whether that death be me or someone else. I would *never* do something like that, the thought does scare me. But it brings me comfort to know a can control things, I have a choice. I heard something similar called “call of the void” on a podcast I listen to. Am I just crazy?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels a lack of control and significance in their life. They describe their life as a repeating cycle of nothingness and mention that the choice to kill or not brings them comfort because it reminds them of their ability to have control. This sense of alienation and lack of purpose may be contributing to their mental disorders.
"Post: My life’s a mess, every day my mind is flooded by suicidal thoughts - yet I’m too much of a pussy to follow through with it. I’m sick of being alone, I want people who love me. But at the same time I hate being around people, it makes me nervous and causes me to overthink everything. I feel like the whole world is out to spoil my day. Everyone of my ex friends I’ve had in my life have all left me. As soon as they found out that I had baggage in the form of mental illness. No sane person gives me a chance, and I don’t blame them, I have to lie constantly to my place of work, because I’ll be let go. To be honest I don’t blame them either, it’s a chore to maintain a relationship with me. I’m not normal, I’m a disgusting human, I’ll let you down if you give me a chance. And I won’t even be sorry.

"Post: Im shocked. I didnt realize how much I had lost. Im not thin by any means, but... Im not really that fat anymore. I think im one of the healthiest people in my family (though most of them are obese or suffer eating disorders). Ive gotten so used to my diet, but now I need to maintain what I have. Losing much more would affect me negatively... But it makes me sad that I still dont like my appearence. I expected I would just suddenly find myself attractive if I hit the right weight, but I still dont. I dont know how to feel about it... I know I should be happy that Ive fulfilled something ive been working on for 3 years, but I still dont feel good enough. Hard to believe people when they say you look good when you cant even get a girlfriend, you know? Guess that counts as a rant. I dunno.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post does mention body image dissatisfaction and a desire for a romantic partner, but it does not provide clear evidence of any specific cause for the mental disorders. It is possible that multiple factors, such as societal pressures, self-esteem issues, and personal expectations, may be contributing to the poster's feelings of inadequacy.

"Post: Anyone else spending the night alone? I'm just gonna fry me up some pork chops, smoke some bud, and play video games. No one to hang out with and I've already been hit by one drunk driver so bars are a no go. O well fuck it! Right?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions spending the night alone and not having anyone to hang out with, indicating a sense of social isolation. The mention of being hit by a drunk driver implies a negative experience in a social setting, potentially contributing to the poster's reluctance to go to bars. The post also mentions using substances (smoking bud) and engaging in leisure activities (playing video games) as a way to cope with their loneliness. This suggests that the cause of mental disorders in this post is related to the lack of fulfilling relationships and the resulting feelings of isolation and limited social opportunities."
"Post: This is going to be a long one. Cliffs: - I thought it was going to be something more - I wasn’t fullfilled - following your dreams doesn’t make you happy - You are sold a lie to get you to consumed This is my story of quiting my job to travel the world and follow what I thought my passion was. So for the past 6 months I have been planning to quit my job so I can start a travel vlog channel on YouTube and work on photography and film making. I bought some gear, I even got free products from companies because they believed in my vision. I honestly thought this was it, like I thought this was going to be my thing. I thought I was on the right path doing this. I thought this would be my dream. I thought travelling the world sharing my pics and videos would make me happy and fullfilled. So after 6 long months, the big day finally arrived. I was so excited guys like I was over the moon about it all. This wasn’t really a holiday for me this was my time to focus on my craft and work towards my goals in youtube, photography and film making. But honestly after a few days something started to change fast. I didn’t really feel good, I felt like annoyed that I had to edit this vlog or edit this photo. I became very unhappy and unfulfilled extremely fast. The only time I felt good was when I was high on mushrooms and drunk on alcohol (that was for nye only) but I started to ask myself “hey do you even enjoy what you are doing” and to be honest I didn’t. I thought travelling the world sharing my journey with everyone would be fullfilling, I had friends and others tell me they were inspired that I had the courage to do this, I kinda felt like they were looking up to me and that my decision to do this would make them more confident for them to go after there dreams and I know that is a very positive thing but that wasn’t motivating for me at all. I am a simple man. I don’t give a **** about money or fame, pretty much my core value is to live a happy and fulliled life and to be surround by good people. The 9-5 isn’t for me. Hats off to you if you are ok with it but for me personally I couldn’t think of anything worse then sit in a box under arterfical light for 8+ hours a day t days a week plus the commute. When the realisation that the thing I thought was going to be my thing wasn’t was the most crushing feeling I have ever felt. It got to the point where I almost broke down. I have had successful online businesses in the past, but even when they were successful I wasn’t happy because I quickly realised this is like a 9-5 where I am only doing it for the money, I felt no joy or fullfillment from it so I quit. I currently do crypto investing, doing alright with it. Made 2k today but honestly yet again I felt no joy front that. I think a lot of people see other people’s lives on tv or social media and say to themselves “I want that life” I was the same, but I quickly realised I was sold a lie. Some of you might comment saying “you are just depressed bro” honestly I don’t think I am, I believe 99% of depression cases are miss diagnosed. I believe a lot of it has to do with people living unfullfied lives. Yes maybe 1% have a chemical imbalance but I strongly believe majority of people are not happy because they are not living unfullfied lives Right now I am thinking of just going home take some time off to revaluate. I must say though this really is painful this feeling. Thinking that something is going to be your passion and honestly believing in the bottom of your heart this is your thing but then realising (especially so fast) that’ it’s not is depressing. I just wanted to make you aware that the whole “quit your job to travel the world thing” might sound cool and all but I promise you it’s not going to make you happy. To me the only way to live a happy and fullfilled life is to do things you actually enjoy, to be on a road and to actually have some sort of direction.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's decision to quit their job and pursue their passion for travel vlogging and photography. However, they quickly realize that this decision does not bring them the happiness and fulfillment they were expecting. They mention feeling unhappy and unfulfilled, even becoming annoyed by the tasks related to their new endeavor. They also mention previous experiences with successful online businesses that did not bring them joy or fulfillment either. This suggests that the mental disorder in this post is related to the poster's dissatisfaction and lack of fulfillment in their chosen career path, indicating that the cause is jobs and career."
"Post: Backstory: I'm 21. My dad just turned 73. I have the typical father / daughter relationship every girl wishes to have. I was spoiled growing up. Yes, he's old. Yes, I was an accident. Yes, my parents are still together. Let's continue. Last year was big for me. Was promoted as the youngest employee company wide to have my position. I moved out. Travelled a LOT. Last year I also learned my dad's cancer had spread and it was a lot more serious this time. I was on my own, living my own life, for 6 months. I realized how bad things had gotten, and I broke my lease and moved back home to help assist my parents with things around the house. In May, he stopped treatment. He was given 6-9 months. We are now at the 9 month mark and he's on his way to a hospital bed in our living room. Meanwhile, my mom is a chainsmoker who is coming down with pneumonia. Back to the point. My father is old, and has lived a very good life. I cannot be angry that his time has come. What I am angry about, however, is the fact I am now lost. Here comes my thought process. Watching my mother take care of my dad in ways I would have never thought possible, how will she handle this when her husband is no longer on this earth? He will without a doubt pass in my childhood home. When is the appropriate time to move out again? Will my mom be okay to take care of herself? I'm taking a lot of time off of work, and my boss is okay with it under the given circumstances. What if I'm not ready to return? My mom lost her mother during the summer of 2015. Now she's losing her husband Spring of 2017, if he makes it that far. As far as family goes, it's just me and my brother, who has a family of his own. She's the type of mom who will spend hundreds of dollars on presents if it means not having to keep in touch daily / be a babysitter etc.. Not because she dislikes us, but because she has always been an independent, introverted.. er, bitch. When she does connect with you, it is something to be adored. She has a very unique way of showing love and it's the only love I have ever known from her. I keep having to remind myself that I am 21 and have my whole life ahead of me, but is that selfish? I'm not looking to abandon her after this is all said and done, but I ~feel~ like I need to return to my life as soon as possible. It's taking a toll on me mentally, and as a result, I'm isolating myself from friends and social gatherings. I just have no desire to do those things anymore. Some days its hard to get out of bed because I can't do anything. It's not that I don't WANT to get up start my day, I just lay there and think, ""whats the point? I don't need plans."" That's new. My parents are in the other room together 90% of the time, while I spend my entire day in my room trying to find things to distract me from my current life. I don't like thinking about the future because I feel exhausted trying to make those thoughts seem realistic. I'm either very irritable or so quiet that I don't think I can talk. The thought of going back to work to make money to resume the life I had seems unpalatable. I guess what I'm saying is, I'm stuck in a very large rut and I don't know what direction to go in, I just know that I need to get out of it. TLDR: My dad is dying of natural causes, I put my life on pause to spend time with him, I realized that my mom might not do too well alone, and I don't know how / when / if I will go back to my life before I moved home or how I want to resume my life to move on.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's current situation, which involves caring for her dying father and concerns about her mother's well-being after her father's passing. The poster also expresses feelings of being lost and unsure about the appropriate time to return to her own life. These concerns and the resulting toll on her mental health, as evidenced by feelings of isolation, lack of motivation, and exhaustion, indicate that relationship issues, specifically related to her family situation, are causing her mental disorders."
"Post: I have progressed to a point where suicide is plaguing my thoughts every day. Any form of distraction: YouTube and Social Media, hanging out with my “friends” school. Nothing can save me, I feel increasingly depressed and lonely. Winter break has interrupted my only form of solace; school. But I even then I had been exponentially losing interest in school and my grades reflect that shift. I can identify that I am failing I am so pathetic all of my friends are just friends with me out of pity I can trust no one. Everyone has abandoned me and I feel like shit every single goddamn day. Thoughts of suicide and all of my past failures and embarrassing moments no matter how small, are all huge and I feel as if everyone Either hates me, takes advantage of me for what little intelligence is left, or is just friends with me out of pity or to bully me and belittle me. I have lost the will to Live ages ago. The only thing that keeps me going is the biological urge to not kill myself but even that is being degraded by all of these thoughts. I cannot go on with this. The sense of depression, embarrassment/cringe, even overpowering nostalgia (if you could call it that) for times of before, where I wasn’t so pathetic and stupid. I want to die  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling increasingly depressed and lonely, as well as thoughts of suicide and a sense of abandonment by friends.

"Post: Really have been struggling with everything lately, and I come into work today and my boss tells my I am no longer meeting expectations and fires me.

"Post: I'm afraid it will go out of hand one day or another. I stop myself from going to places and talking to people, just to feel miserable afterward, then I bask in my misery.

"Post: When I was a kid I loved to write little short stories and draw random stuff, wherever my mind was inspired to go. Now I’m 20 and thanks to depression it feels like my mind can’t digest anything. A movie or TV show might be really interesting every now and then, or a song might spark some emotional response, but then 5 minutes later I pick up a pen and everything I know about creativity goes down the drain. I just feel empty. I hate it. I wish I were a kid again, where I would be excited to create anything that comes to mind. Nothing’s up there. How do I get my imagination to ever work again?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a lack of creativity and a struggle with their imagination due to depression.

"Post: Had a session with my therapist before the beginning of New Year's Eve. I was trying to explain to her my greatest fear. The fear of never being understood. I was diagnosed with depression in year of 2011. Since then I have sought out treatment in the form of talk therapy and medication. And in all this time, even before I was educated about my ""illness"", not once has anyone I've come into contact with been able to see the world with my eyes. Yet I can be so understanding and kind and caring and able to walk in the shoes of others. I want to make others smile, be happy, and laugh. It's why I'm reading, studying, and practicing to become an actor. But I can no longer hide behind this mask of false images and hopes that ""things will get better"". How is it I can live a solid twenty four years on this planet, down to the exact seconds from which I was born today, being part of a sociable species of animals dubbed humans and still not have a genuine connection with a single person? How? Bar forced seclusion and isolation practices, it should not be possible. I should not be possible. Yet I persist and endure and struggle to live as a thing. A creature. A human not worth the very effort it took to create and make this pathetic existence I call life something worth living. My therapist heard a similar story to what I have just written from me, (minus the whole being alive for a full twenty four years part), and it sounded like she was trying to contemplate an answer to justify my thinking as being a product of my depression. By this time tears were sliding down my face one drop at a time. Yet I felt as stern as an emotionless being. Then she said something that caught me off guard in a voice as sad and as hurt as a mother pleading for the safety of her child. She said, ""please don't hurt yourself"". The thing is, I can't understand if she was crying for me or for what I had just said being reflected off my face. And even if she was starting to cry......., why? Why cry for someone who has no place in society. Why cry for someone who cannot be fathomed by his peers or parents? Why cry at all for this hollow wound of a human she saw before her? Just why?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post indicates a deep sense of isolation and a lack of understanding from others. The poster expresses their fear of never being understood and their inability to connect with anyone on a genuine level. They feel like an outsider and question why anyone would cry or care about someone like them who they perceive as having no place in society. This strong sense of alienation and disconnection from others is likely contributing to the mental disorders mentioned, such as depression and feelings of worthlessness."

"Post: Sometimes i can be happy, sometimes i can smile and sometimes i can laugh. but most of the time when I'm alone or in school or anywhere i just feel so.. alone empty sad depressed everything combined and i just feel so alone i don't really have any friends at school most of my friends are online and there aren't too many of them but I'm generally happy with my group of friends but i still feel so alone, my parents love me they give me kisses thought it is embarrassing and hugs and cuddles and i feel for a brief moment happiness but after a while i just feel empty sad alone..i don't know if I'm depressed but i thought this might be the best place to post this..if you have any questions like any i dunno just ask  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none.

"Post: I'm a 15 year old kid, I've been putting up with lots of verbal and emotional abuse from my parents, just got screamed at again. Really done with this bullshit, I just want to die.

"Post: My wife completely dismisses my depression and also tries to tell me its just an excuse. If I am having an off/bad day she says I am just being an asshole and am trying to ruin her day and sometimes she even goes as far to say that I am ruining her life. I have times when I am down that I cannot be as attentive or give her 100% of my attention, but if I try to say I am just having an off day she says I am just trying to find an excuse for my behavior and not taking ownership of it. There have been days where she says she wants me to get out or leave and I have wanted to, so that I can get away from the pain, but I never do and I end up staying and hoping to just work things out or that maybe I deserve how she treats me. The only thing I feel is really keeping me there with her are out kids, who are the light of my life.

Post: I do. Every time I look back on my past and even in my present I try to justify my shitty behavior because I keep thinking that maybe I'm just a good person on the inside.

"Post: I don't want to write a long story to don't make it boring for you. Let's just say that I don't think that i'm worth living here. Im tired of my own life. First I'm so ugly and don't tell me that everyone is beautiful because i literally am ugly. A lot of people told me that straight to myself. I care about my health but i can't do anything with my ugly face. Second i'm not good at anything and in school i'm the one to joke about. My friend left me week ago because i was boring for her. Its really hard for me because she was the only one who cared about me. I have a lot of passions and sens of humor but who actually cares? I have also difficult family. They arent loving and supporting me, because i don't want to do in my life what they wanted me to and im so hopeless. I want to kill my self couse no one needs me and i'm hurting here. I'm thinking about it for so long. I wanted to write it, maybe someone will notice me. I feel so lonely and hopeless. I know that you'll probably think that i'm complaining and i'm selfish and that i'm a kid that doesn't know anything about life. (couse i'm 16) . I also want to apologize for my english, because it's not my native language and i'm still learning. Sorry for taking your time and thanks for everything.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of worthlessness, ugliness, and being the subject of jokes at school. The poster also mentions the recent loss of a friend who was the only person who cared about them. They describe their family as difficult and unsupportive, causing feelings of hopelessness.

"Post: I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave. I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all. This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it. Is this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling low, anxious, and upset leading up to the night at the club. The poster describes an overwhelming feeling that they should leave, even though they had previously enjoyed going to the club. They also mention a recent change in their behavior, feeling the desire to stay in bed and do nothing. These feelings of isolation and disconnection, combined with a change in behavior, suggest a sense of alienation as the cause of their mental disorders. The poster is worried that this behavior may be the start of depression, indicating a concern about their emotional well-being and a possible sense of disconnect from their own emotions."
"Post: I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state. I was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to. Gender and Sexuality =============== I grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage. In expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. Unfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice. All in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world. Socialization ============== I am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. I am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah). Despite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? I'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. Relationships =============== I don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though. Current partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues. The abridged version of my life: ================ As a child, I was very depressed due to life circumstances out of my control. Many of the relatives that I was close to straight up died, moved away, or quit speaking to me due  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of trauma and abuse, including bullying, abusive relationships, and experiences of being mistreated by authority figures.

"Post: Tonight my roommates and I watched a movie together, then they left to go have dinner with her parents. And I sat at home and cried. I left my job 2 weeks ago, but no one has called me back about my resume. I barely eat, but am gaining weight. I'm tired yet oversleeping. My dad told me that the doctors give him a year, maybe. It's all so much. I'm so... not done. I can't say done. Done is... not an option. So... here's to a better year. Here's to the last year ill have with my dad. I want to make it a good one.

Post: I always end up feeling worse than I did before. Girls always wanna get close I never let them. Can anyone relate or am I alone on this topic?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"none. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior.

Therefore, it is more appropriate to assign ""None"" as the cause of mental disorders in this post."
"Post: Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work. She asked whether it's ok if my family would know (If they asked questions after christmas etc) and I told her it would be ok. First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain. While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"". I do the fuck not know how to deal with this shit either. Getting drunk now. Thx for reading.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: Is there anyone else here that has so much but doesn't feel like they really deserve any of it? Personally I've got a few really close friends from home and college, a great GPA, a good job, a family that probably isn't as bad as I think it is, and we're getting by financially, even if it is a bit tough. I think about my situation compared to some of the others I read on here and I question why I'm so depressed. Even with all that I have, I feel like I don't deserve what I have, and someone who can actually enjoy them should have them instead. Thinking that I'm the one who gets it instead just makes me feel worse about it really I wanna just throw it all away, disappear without anyone knowing where I went but I know that won't fix anything  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation.

Post: Even though some of my friends tell me otherwise I still feel guilty of what I've done and unworthy of everything  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"relationship.

"Post: Possibly most of my depression stems from dwelling on things that happened in the past. Things that could have been and should have not.

"Post: I've had about three interviews and a couple phone interviews and nothing yet. I know it's the holidays and no one is hiring en masse yet. But, God, sitting around the house sucks. I miss just buying things without having to do quick mental math to see if I could afford it. I intend on joining the plumbers union, but God help me if I don't get in.

Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's frustration with the job search process and the financial strain they are experiencing as a result.

Post: I told a guy who I thought was my friend something personal. It wasn’t too deep but something anyone with half a brain should know not to share. I told my “friend” not to share it. I only told him something personal because he wanted to know more about me. So I opened up. But I also told him not to tell people about my family. I thought he was cool and we were friends for a couple weeks. I was new to making friends after deciding to open out of my shell. But now that this asshole tells people lies and rumors about me it just broke me. He tried texting me saying he didn’t say anything but obviously I’m not that stupid. This seriously just broke me down. I hate people who use me for company. I just can’t trust anyone or make friends. Now the school thinks I’m a crazy weirdo. Some fvcked up lies have been said about me. I don’t even talk to anyone besides a couple people. How did this happen. Assholes. :(  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a friend betraying the poster's trust and spreading lies and rumors about them.

"Post: I hate taking my pills, I feel so numb and dizzy. And whenever the pill wear off I just get so depressed because of the thoughts that I have to take pills to be happy.

"Post: It’s been a good break so far, as school is the source of most of my triggers for depression and I’m also in Florida which helps combat seasonal depression, but something’s off. I just feel unsatisfied. Like, now that I’m feeling better, I’m seeing how bad I’ve been living. I see what I want to improve now, but it’s overwhelming. I’m so close to having energy to take on these challenges, but right now I still hardly have energy to get out of bed. Any suggestions?

"Post: Jan. 17, 2017 I told myself I was sick of going through every year wanting to die, wishing for death, and that if things hadn't changed I wouldn't see the start of 2018. For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point. Happy New Year friends  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: While the post mentions a history of suicidal thoughts and attempts, it does not suggest that medication is the cause of the mental disorders described. The poster does not mention taking any medication or experiencing any medication-related side effects."
"Post: I just turned 20 in mid December, I don’t have a job, I don’t go to school and my girlfriend (of two years) that told me she wanted to be together forever and even shared a dog with me has been ignoring me since Thanksgiving. I caught her getting almost daily voicemails left on her phone by a guy I was clear I wasn’t okay with the flirting with. Today I got a text out of the blue saying She wants to meet in person this week to “move on”. Every part of me still wants to be with her and it kills me to think of a life without her; especially after going as far as planning our futures together. I thought the holidays were going to be the worst of it, but I’m slowly realizing that when everyone is getting back into their routines I’m still stuck. I want to get a job and go to school and be successful, but I feel trapped in this dark pit. I really don’t want to live anymore and the only thing keeping me from killing my self is the pain and disarray I would cause my Mom and Dad. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants daily; I have since I was 13. I don’t want to open myself up completely to my therapist because of my fears of being shipped to a mental health hospital. My parents in the past have seriously suggested that I stay in one. I don’t know it’s hard to believe you can live a normal life or be normal after you’ve been locked in a psych ward.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions various relationship-related issues that are likely contributing to the poster's mental disorders. They mention their girlfriend ignoring them, catching her flirting with someone else, and their subsequent breakup. These relationship problems are causing feelings of heartbreak, thoughts of suicide, and a sense of being trapped in a dark pit. The post also mentions fearing being sent to a mental health hospital, likely due to past suggestions from their parents. All of these issues point to relationship-related stress and trauma as the cause of the mental disorders in this post."
"Post: So I’ve been having depression for the past 1.5 Years now, went to a psychiatrist for the whole time. Parents got divorced, I’m getting my insurance cut off so I can no longer afford the psychiatrist anymore. I work part time and go to university full time. My moms been trying to switch car insurances but some places refused because of my driving record (3 accidents, 1 ticket) and the one were at now is out of our pay range. I’m just really tired. Literally a waste of money. My boyfriend of 6 months recently ghosted me so the wound is still fresh. I don’t know what to do, I just feel like a waste and a burden. Since my boyfriend disappeared there’s no one I can talk to honestly. I just want someone to hug me and tell me things will be okay.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of depression and regular visits to a psychiatrist, but the poster can no longer afford the psychiatrist due to insurance being cut off. They also mention working part-time and going to university full-time, indicating potential job-related stress and financial strain.

"Post: Happy new year everyone I hope u had a good time I may be alone Tonight but i wont give up yet. One day I'll be a friend to someone if not, well I got my crippling shyness it will never leave me. I feel dumb for being depressed for this but truth be told i never had a friend since i was a kid.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling alone and expresses a desire to have a friend.

"Post: I had a week off over Christmas. My family is all overseas so I was not busy or rushed. I took things easy and slow and didn't do much. It really alleviated the pressures of life and did help my depression a bit. Now that I'm back at work I feel incredibly depressed - way more than before. I had a taste of feeling relaxed but crashed to the ground. I need time off to just sort out what I want to do in life, but at work during the week it's all rush rush rush and stress and chores and anxiety. At the end of the day I am just exhausted and do need to sleep or rest. I know what helps - having time off to just figure stuff out. But it's just so unobtainable.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's experience of feeling depressed, the alleviation of depression during their week off, and the return of increased depression upon returning to work. They express a need for time off to figure out what they want to do in life and mention the rush, stress, and anxiety associated with their job. However, they also acknowledge that taking time off is unobtainable. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder is not related to bias or abuse, jobs and career, relationship issues, alienation, or lack of support, but rather the lack of time off and rest to manage their mental health. Therefore, the assigned label is medication, as the poster may benefit from medication to manage their depression in the absence of being able to take time off."
"Post: I've just been prescribed Citalopram 20mg - started treatment today. I do like a drink on the evenings, just to help me relax a bit but I'm aware that's a product of whatever's going on and I'm going to reel it in. Not drink on the evenings and wind myself down some other way. Although, with that being said I love to spend time with my friends and normally we drink a fair amount - go home then go to bed kinda deal. Would it still be okay to get a bit wavy and let my hair down every now and then whilst on the meds?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions being prescribed medication (Citalopram) and the poster's intention to stop drinking alcohol in order to manage their mental health. They also ask for advice on whether it's okay to occasionally drink while on the medication. This indicates that the poster is concerned about the potential effects of alcohol on their mental health and medication. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is related to the medication and the poster's behavior of drinking alcohol."
"Post: OK so here goes the story, please help. We?ve been dating long-distance for 3 years. He used to love me to the moon and back. He?s from NZ and I?m from Mexico, he?s 22 and I?m 31. He had already broken up with me 3 months ago saying that his feelings for me were fading away but he already had a plain ticket to come see me for November. 3 days ago he broke up with me saying that he needs to be alone, that he needs to figure things out, that the distance is too hard (We were planning on me moving there in 2 years until he finished university) we already had been through 3 years together, 3 very hard years as well where my father died and I lost my mind to depression and anxiety. He says he doesn't love me anymore at least not like a partner but that he?ll always love me as a friend. Could this be the depression? he says he doesn't know what he wants and that he just wants to be alone. I don't know what to do here since I was working a job that I didn't really liked but that would give me lots of job opportunities in NZ i was planning my future around him. I battled depression as well and the last thought in my mind was breaking up with him. Which is why I can?t understand why he broke up with me. He says he needs all his focus on himself to get better but I didn't need that when I went through depression.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post describes a long-distance relationship that has recently ended. The poster mentions that they have battled depression and anxiety in the past, and they question whether their ex-partner's decision to break up could be related to depression. They also express confusion and disappointment over the breakup, as they had been planning their future around the relationship. This suggests that the end of the relationship is causing significant emotional distress for the poster, indicating that the cause of the mental disorder in this post is relationship-related."

"Post: I've been suffering with anxiety and depression for a while now but it has increasingly gotten worse within the last year and I feel like there is no getting better. I have not seeked medical advice as I dont know where to start and what to say. I dont know what made me this way and I just wish it was as simple as popping to the shops and buying some pills to make it all better. There is more important things in the world than me and I dont want to waste anyones time. I used to cope by keeping myself busy and pushing myself to do anything and everything to avoid having to sit with just my own thoughts for company. But its beating me and the motivation to do anything is becoming none existent, it's like I want to but I cant push through the voices in my head and the pressure on my chest. My friends seem to be becoming more and more distant with little understanding on whats going on with me but too wrapped up in their own lifes. A hand full of my work collegues seem to be going through a similar thing but can come off quite judgemental and I honestly think if I confided in them they would just think I was after attention and 'jumping on the bandwagon'. And the other hand full slag off depression as if it doesnt exist or they are worse off as if its a competition. My family have their own issues and I feel as much as they would love to help they need to focus on themselves and each other. My boyfriend is the one person I thought I could rely on to speak to and make me feel at comfort if not better when im at my worst but nearly a month ago he nearly broke up with me. I fear its gotten too much for him. He has since said he didnt mean it and you dont realise what you've got until its nearly gone but its broken me. The one person I thought I could be myself with and express my true feelings and now its just another face to put on. Life just feels like one massive show at the moment that i'm doing on my own and trying my best to see it through until the end. Can things just suddenly get better? What do you do to make yourself feel better?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing anxiety and depression, as well as feeling increasingly worse within the last year. The poster also expresses a sense of loneliness and isolation, as their friends are becoming distant and wrapped up in their own lives. They mention a lack of understanding from their friends and colleagues, and fear that they would be judged or accused of seeking attention if they confided in them. The poster's family also has their own issues to focus on. Additionally, the post mentions a breakdown in the relationship with their boyfriend, which has further exacerbated their feelings of brokenness. Overall, the post's focus on strained relationships and lack of support indicates that relationship-related factors are contributing to their mental disorders."
"Post: Tried a couple of them, and I'll be honest with you: I absolutely dreaded them both. I don't want to get deep into it, but one of my therapists took time during our session just to talk with someone personal on their cellphone. (Hard to believe, I know.) I've heard from a few people who have taken therapy say that you have to find the right therapist for you. But hearing that argument convinces me that I'm essentially paying people to listen to me until I find someone that says the right thing to comfort/""save"" me. Maybe it's just my brain telling me that, but it just rationalizes my personal stigma towards seeking professional help for myself.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a negative experience with therapy and feeling unsatisfied with previous attempts at seeking help. The poster expresses skepticism about the idea that they need to find the right therapist, indicating a lack of trust or connection in their therapeutic relationships. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder may be related to their negative experiences with relationships, specifically in the context of seeking professional help."
"Post: Keeping up the facade at work is cutting too deep these days. I feel a great deal of stress with my work and having this heaped on top certainly doesn't help. I can't sleep, I can't eat right... I'm just so tired of my shitty life and my bitterness at being so alone while the few friends I have are all happy in their relationships. I'm constantly the 3rd or 5th wheel. I know I'm a forever alone and nothing can ever change my situation but it's still just so painful, but at work I have to put on a fake smile and pretend there's nothing wrong.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a great deal of stress related to work and having to maintain a facade. The poster also expresses feelings of loneliness and bitterness, particularly in comparison to their friends who are in relationships. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder is related to their job and career, as well as feelings of isolation and longing for a romantic relationship."
"Post: My depression has been getting so bad that I'm sluggish after even a few days of getting up, going to work, and doing what I need to do. Over the course of the next few months, I'm working, going back to school, auditioning for a musical, organizing an event in a nearby city, and then there's my social life. As you may notice, I organized a lot of these things when I was feeling ""up"". Now that I'm starting to come down, I don't know how to get myself back up. I used to do it so easily  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","none. Reasoning: The post describes symptoms of depression and the struggle to maintain motivation and energy, particularly in regards to the various activities the poster has planned. While the post does mention a change in mood from feeling ""up"" to starting to come down, it does not suggest any specific cause for the mental disorders, such as bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation. The cause of the mental disorders in this post remains unclear, so the assigned label is None."
"Post: I seriously don't know what is wrong with me. The best way that I could describe it is 2 tracks are constantly playing in my head. One that is normal and happy. I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life. But for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike. Well I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max. I don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that. In fact when I read the stories of people who are depressed or anxious I ENVY them. Because they seem to be upset about something concrete. Like they feel inadequate. They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me. There's nothing in the real world that totally takes over my mind, because no matter WHAT i am thinking about, always what is playing in the back of my head is ""this is pointless, this is pointless, this is pointless..."" But clearly there is something very chemically wrong with my brain and I just cannot take it anymore. I dream of going to the doctor and finding that I have a terminal illness, so that it will end and I will finally be free of the rock.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post describes the presence of two tracks playing in the poster's mind, one expressing positive emotions and appreciation for life, and the other constantly discussing the meaninglessness of everything. The poster mentions feeling a sense of relief during brief respites when they feel normal, but these moments are short-lived. They also state that they do not believe they have depression, as they experience positive thoughts and do not feel socially isolated or inadequate. The poster expresses a desire to find a concrete root for their mental distress, but is unable to do so. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post may be related to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which may require medication to address."
"Post: Where do I start? I guess the background: I am in nursing school, and this past semester broke me, I developed anxiety, and my depression returned. I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress. Well last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. This thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. You see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. When I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help. So I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. So about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there. Thank you for reading, and I hope we all can overcome this.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's history of anxiety and depression, as well as their current use of medication (Prozac) to manage their symptoms. They also mention experiencing an intrusive thought about wanting to die, which caused significant fear and led them to seek medical help.

Therefore, the cause of the mental disorder in this post is directly related to the use of medication for anxiety and depression, as well as the presence of migraines."
"Post: I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse.

"Post: Bad family, just got out of a bad relationship, have always been bad at making friends (serious social anxiety). This ain't abnormal but I stay in contact with toxic people because I'm just desperate for that human warmth. I spend so much time seeking literal warmth as a replacement. I take like 10 baths a day. I swaddle myself up in blankets. I am so emotionally freezing.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship.

"Post: Maybe if my leg was broken or I was diagnosed with a life threatening illness they would have cared more. It seems that mental illness does not have a place in this world.

"Post: I have a lot of good things going for me, but I have no interest in putting effort into those things. My first semester of college went pretty well, but I just don’t care about what I’m doing. I don’t care if I ever get a job or a girlfriend or have a family. I could die alone and be completely indifferent to it. It genuinely feels effortful to try to care about things and have an interest in them. I don’t see a point in sharing my condition with anyone because if I’m being honest they’re not going to understand.

"Post: I broke up with my girlfriend about 3 months ago because I wanted to move to a place she didn’t want to move to, I really wanted to move there as I’ve always wanted to live there and I have lots of friends there, so we broke up and I moved. For the first 3 months I was really happy and perfectly fine, I was sad of course from losing my girlfriend of a year and a half but it had to happen if I wanted to move and I knew that. These last couple of days though I just feel so lonely and depressed, I just want to drink constantly, I drank last night and the night before, and it’s only 11am and I already feel like drinking again.

"Post: My truck metaphor of the things that run me over all ay once everyday. It's a long story I could probably write a book... i might write a book... lol I used to struggle HEAVILY with severe anxiety and my parents would belittle it until I was having anxiety attacks and even then they said that therapists were for crazy people (my parents are very traditional and care about what others could say about you). My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down. Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space. And that was new because I've never loved someone like I love him. He is the light of my life and existence no matter how much shit we have been through in the last 3.5y. Yoga and meditation and send awareness got me though that, mostly. Regardles... very very long story continues and I'm not used to things going well so when I have a small problem or inconvenience I react and prepare to be hit by my metaphorical truck.. Also my day could be great and I get home and my family ruins anything and everything. Sorry this is all over the place but so are my emotions.

"Post: My family loves me. I'm only 17. I have a couple of close friends. I'm not broke, my house has heat, I have a Nintendo Switch. I laugh... I was fine until I saw this girl. ""Speak to her."" Hah! Thanks, but it's never so easy. She's plagued my mind, she's all I think about. She's destroying my mind and she doesn't even know me. I see her every single day. All I do is dwell. Dwell she's not mine. It's my own fault. I'm the one who stays quiet. Well, she does too, of course, but I think you catch my drift. I was fine. Now I'm not. I'm literally losing my fucking mind. Abusing disgusting amounts of various vile medications provided by my father's prescriptions. I've noticed a difference in my brain since I've touched those pills. I'm actually losing it. Anxiety. Depression. Insanity. Bipolar. Lost in a pitch black labyrinth called ""Life"". Therapist is nice but, talking about your fever won't cure it. Fuck Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, fuck it. My mind is becoming like a messy room. On the verge of a noose. Is this the end? Is this life? Am I done for? We ask these questions. Redundancy.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a girl who is plaguing the poster's mind and causing them distress.

"Post: I'm using an alt because earlier this month someone went through my post history and harassed me for posting here. Literally every interaction I've had on this website lately has been shit.

"Post: I need help. My mom said that I used to be happy, just for the sake of being happy. I can't even remember when that was. Every time I try to talk about my issues, I end up asking the same questions over and over, borderline asking people to shower me with complements and reminders of my good qualities. My mother is annoyed to no end by this. I don't want to do the same to my friends. As stated in the title, I have lost the will to live. The timing couldn't be worse, as I'm about to start talking classes for my GED, which I will need to talk because I fucked up in high school by being lazy and not doing my homework. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I feel as though I am ""at peace"". I don't care if I'm going to die anymore. Maybe at most I'll shed a tear and ask to say goodbye. But, I am not at peace, for if I were, I wouldn't have such feelings of my own insecurities and self loathing. I don't know what to do to feel better, as every time I am even the slightest bit happy, it always goes away too soon, and I miss that feeling greatly. The biggest worry right now, is my borderline nihilism, the possibility that nothing matters; there is no point. I am unsure at best about whether or not this philosophy is true. I hope dearly that it's not.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling unhappy, having lost the will to live, and a sense of nihilism. It also mentions the upcoming start of classes for a GED, which suggests that the poster may be feeling overwhelmed by the pressure and expectations related to their education and future career prospects.

"Post: I'm 18 years old, been struggling with depression for about 2 years but it really surfaced the last few months. I live together with my 3 best friends because my home is too far away from school. Turns out one of them stole about 750-1000 eu from my room + A LOT of weed. I sell weed to get by because i was blown away by how expensive living on your own is. Now all of my money is gone and i'm 1300eu in debt by my dealer. My gf was the only one trusted and i (still) love her dearly. But unfortunately she broke up with me just now because she can't be with someone who has such a negative self image of himself, and because i was never there for her (i did everything i could but sometimes you just can't do shit because of the depression and she doesnt believe that). She also said that i am selfish and that the whole relationship revolved around me, wich was the saying that hurt me the most. I completely lost track of my own to get her to feel good, but nah she wouldn't have it. Commenting on my best friend who is jobless atm but worked HARD everyday on roofs and such for 2 years, saying he's a loafer with no ambition and i will become the same as him got me running to my car, bawling like a little kid (wich is something that nearly never happened in the past 5 years, i'm pretty 'cold-hearted'). We just returned from a super nice city trip where everything was as good as it could get, wich gave me hope because i tought that might be the spark our realtionship needed (we've been struggling in our realtionship for about a month) but i guess she didn't think so... Everyday i have this urge to just drive against a pillar or off of a bridge but i can always come to my sensen when i think about my parents, who support me A LOT. But lately even that doesn't do the trick. I wake up and think about the best way to kill myself. So; i try to escape. Benzodiazepines are my love now, but i know i gotta quit that shit asap. Unfortunately this can't be done atm. I'm too weak to do it sober. I don't even know why i bother writing this because no one gives a fuck about me (except for my parents probably) and this'll get buried anyways. I looked forward so much to celebrate my bday (14 january) with my gf in a cosy restaurant and its all gone to shit. Sorry for the weird text, im fucked up on benzos and alcohol and english isn't my native language. This could be a goodbey, idk and idc frankly. For anyone who read all the way to the end, thanks  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a number of relationship issues and challenges that the poster is facing. They discuss a roommate who stole from them, a girlfriend who broke up with them and criticized their self-image, and feeling alone and unsupported. The post also mentions feeling a strong urge to die and using benzodiazepines and alcohol as a means of escape. These relationship issues and feelings of isolation and despair are likely contributing to the poster's mental disorders."
"Post: So I don’t know for sure that I am depressed, but it really does feel like it. I don’t feel loved or cared about. Like I’m not special, I’m nobody’s favorite person. But I know this isn’t true. My family loves me very much. My mom, dad, sister, they all care for me so much, and I can tell. I don’t necessarily have feelings that strong for them, but I’ve never felt very strongly about anyone. Does that make me wrong? To feel so unloved even though they do? Even if they are the only ones, why do I feel so bad? What’s wrong?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling unloved and not special, despite having a family that the poster acknowledges loves and cares for them. This suggests a distorted perception of their relationships, which could be indicative of biased thinking or past experiences of abuse that affect their self-perception and ability to feel loved. Therefore, the assigned label is ""Bias or abuse."""
"Post: April 2015. My sister took her life. It's been almost 2 years and I sought help a little after she passed. I fooled everyone, including myself, that I was slowly but surely getting better. Truth is, I just kept it locked away, like I always do. Recent events in my life have opened up some wounds, and I'm realizing the depression I felt 10 years ago in high school is still there. Feelings of being a failure, feelings of letting people down, feelings of not wanting to live are resurfacing. I'm not saying I want to take my life, but I don't want to live. Suicide would be cruel to my loved ones because they would have to deal with that twice. But if I didn't wake up tomorrow, I feel like that would be the best from everyone. I'm a miserable person, I'm selfish and I'm toxic. But I'm charismatic and I've hidden all this away for so long so no one knows my true pain. The truth is, I basically killed my sister. I know that's what many family survivors of suicide say, but I knew my sister had some troubles. She was sad, she had been caught cutting and making suicidal threats for the past couple of years. And yet, I chose to ignore the warning signs because ""If I could get through it, she could."" My dad and her got into an argument one night, and I didn't help her. I even said aloud to my brother, ""She's going to kill herself one day."" A month later, she did. If I wasn't so selfish, I would have helped her, but I just wanted to get on with my life. I'm seeing now, all I bring people is pain. I'm venom. But since I'm friendly and well-liked people still gravitate toward my toxic orbit. The sooner I die, the better off the world will be.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the suicide of the poster's sister and expresses feelings of guilt, shame, and self-blame. The poster admits to ignoring warning signs and not intervening when their sister was in distress, which likely contributes to their feelings of failure, letting people down, and not wanting to live. The post also discusses the poster's perception of themselves as a toxic and harmful person, suggesting a negative self-image and possible issues with self-esteem. All of these factors point to a relationship-related cause of the mental disorders described in the post."
Post: I know this sort of post isn’t original or whatever but here it is. It’s New Years Eve today where I am and honestly... I don’t think I could care any less. I’m so tired of pretending to give a shit about everything. About people about things about university and assignments. Mostly I’m tired of other people pretending to give a shit about me because they don’t. That’s it. They don’t. My family say they care yet constantly bombard me with all of their problems expecting me to have a magical solution. My friends are going through their own shit and whilst they try there’s nothing they can do for me. My girlfriend well... that’s something else entirely. I know she’s not happy. I know she’d rather not be with me. She’s been down this road before got the T shirt she shouldn’t have to deal with my bs too. I love her so much I don’t want to put her through this. But the issue is I can’t ever see myself getting better. It feels impossible. All I want to do everyday is stay in bed. I want to sleep all of the time. Half the time I’m not even physically tired I just... everything is too much effort. I can’t win. I really can’t. I’ve been trying for years but it never gets better. Not for people like me. We’re destined to suffer and bleed and cry forever. What sort of life is that? I don’t think I want to see the New Year. I just want to end it all.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling tired of pretending to care about everything, including their job, university, and assignments. They also mention feeling overwhelmed by other people's problems and not feeling supported by their family, friends, and girlfriend. They express a sense of hopelessness and a belief that they will never get better. This indicates that the cause of their mental disorders may be related to job-related stress and feelings of being overwhelmed and unsupported in their career and academic pursuits."
"Post: I've had a rough two weeks and can't study for shit right now. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone and thoughts of suicide are having a hayday. Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing. My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off. My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and suicidal, as well as a lack of belief in oneself. These feelings are likely exacerbated by the poster's perception of being alone and unable to talk to anyone about their struggles. They mention that their family is preoccupied with the sickness of their grandparents, leaving them feeling helpless and unable to contribute or seek support. This sense of isolation and burden is contributing to the poster's mental disorders and can be attributed to a sense of alienation."
"Post: Ever since I started college (I'm a junior now) I feel so different than the person I was in High School. Back then people would tell me that I was funny, chill, nice, I was genuinely interested in people and made friends easily. But now I feel the opposite, like I'm just a dick, I never want to hangout with my friends and these are guys I have been best friends with since I was 5. We were literally inseparable, but now even keeping up with them in our groupme has become a chore, at this point my friends don't even want to talk to me anymore. Recently even the thought of having a social interaction is so scary that when it actually happens I feel like I seem distant and uninterested causing people to dislike me. I wish I knew how/why this all started, I just want to be me again, not this boring asshole who never has anything to say. I haven't told anybody this because I'm afraid they either won't believe me or think I just want attention, and I really just don't know what to do. Its like I just want to be left alone but I know that is not how I want to live my life. Sorry for the rant I just feel lost.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling different since starting college and experiencing a shift in their social interactions and relationships. They describe feeling like a different person and no longer exhibiting the positive qualities they had in high school. They express a desire to reconnect with their friends and regain their previous self, but also feeling scared and distant in social interactions. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders may be related to changes in their relationships and social dynamics since starting college."
"Post: So, I have really bad emetophobia. That means I have a fear of vomit. ?I have horrible dreams about vomit every night. Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish for? expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,? she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. This hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. I'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless. Also posted in rbn  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","medication. Reasoning: The post mentions emetophobia, which is a specific phobia related to a fear of vomiting. The poster discusses having frequent nightmares about vomit and experiencing extreme anxiety and panic in situations where vomiting may occur. They also mention their family's reaction to their anxiety, with their mother getting upset and telling them not to ruin the family's day. This indicates that the poster's mental disorder, in this case, is likely caused by their fear of vomiting and the lack of understanding and support from their family. Medication may be a potential solution to manage their anxiety and phobia symptoms."

"Post: Someone who will make me feel loved. Someone who will not be annoyed when I text her in the morning, or one that will make me smile when I see her text saying good morning or good night Someone who will makes feel like somebody and someone who will love me for who I am as I am for her. _________________________________ I have been searching that particular person for years. But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me. Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life Could be because she found a spark with someone else. Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant. Could be because she was not who I thought she was Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again. *And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens* It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's repeated experiences of finding someone they connect with and then suddenly losing that person. They also mention feeling cursed and as if fate is taking away their happiness whenever they find a sense of peace and tranquility. This suggests a pattern of relationship-related issues and difficulties in finding and maintaining connections with others, which may be contributing to the poster's mental disorders."
"Post: I have no reason to feel this way. I am surrounded by loving family and caring friends but is there a reason for me just listening to slow music that appeals to me personally most nights and just feeling sad? I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in. And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad. I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it. Im not searching for a solution, just a means to understand this P.s if anyone's actually interested the music i was listening to was the exis mixtape by roy woods and free 6lack by 6lack  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling sad despite being surrounded by loving family and caring friends. The poster also expresses a sense of self-doubt, loneliness, and a lack of luck with relationships. They mention that when they are socializing or using humor, they temporarily feel relief from these negative feelings, but they always return when they are alone. The post also mentions a recent failed relationship and the poster's difficulty in communicating with girls they are interested in. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's struggles and dissatisfaction with their relationships or lack thereof."
Post: I feel like I’m not even a functioning human at this point. The amount of effort needed to simply get out of bed or do my homework unbearable. This is the first time where I have been able to see the physical effects of my depression just looking at myself in the mirror. And I’m at a point where my anxiety that comes with it is so bad that I would rather not do my homework and get yelled at than even think about it. I’ve never told anyone I’m depressed and I just kinda be the funny one at school or with my friends. I’ve never gone to a doctor or psychologist or anything about my depression but I think I may be bipolar. I do (or did) go to a psychologist for ADHD and they said when I was like 10 I might be at risk for developing bipolar disorder. But that was that I’m 14 now and that’s my theory. I don’t even know if I’m over reacting or something I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening to my rant.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ,"alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of depression, anxiety, and difficulty getting out of bed or completing tasks. The poster expresses a sense of being disconnected from others, as they mention never having told anyone about their depression and instead being the funny one at school or with friends. This suggests a sense of isolation and a lack of support, which can contribute to mental health disorders. Additionally, the poster mentions a theory that they may be bipolar based on a previous assessment for ADHD, indicating a lack of professional help or guidance in understanding their mental health. All of these factors point to the cause of the mental disorders in this post being alienation."
"Post: What do you think about anti depressants? Do they work, are they bs, do they only trick you into feeling better at the beginning? Want to know people's take on meds.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ",alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions anti-depressants and raises questions about their effectiveness and people's opinions on them. This suggests that the poster may be feeling alienated or disconnected from the medical community or society's perception of mental health and treatment options. They may feel unsure or skeptical about medication and are seeking others' opinions to potentially validate or challenge their own beliefs. This sense of alienation or disconnection regarding the use of medication for mental health is likely contributing to their mental disorders.
"Post: I am 24 years old , unattractive, not smart(learning disability, autism), depression(since age 10, wanted to kill myself that young...yeah I know. My mood swings from ""normal"" to ""irrational"" very quickly. SOmetimes in short bursts. Basically I go from zero to asshole in seconds), no friends, etc. Yeah what do I do about it. I guess accepting my fate is what i'll do guys... THe problem I don't know what to do about it, not so much of an issue of ""trying harder"", but understanding what I need to do ""not be depressed"" anymore. There really is no escape for me in this depression land. I might have to learn to like it I guess.... Well lets see how I feel tommorw morning reading this irrational post.. The therapists aren't helping and its kinda discouraging... I don't need to ""work on my self esteem"". I am sick of that bullshit some counselors are trained to teach. Are they really that stupid?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors that contribute to the poster's mental disorders, including their self-perceived unattractiveness, learning disability and autism, history of depression since a young age, and difficulty managing mood swings. They also mention a lack of friends and dissatisfaction with therapy. While the post does not explicitly mention specific relationship issues, the overall tone suggests a sense of loneliness, frustration with their own self-perceived inadequacies, and a lack of support from others. These factors contribute to the mental disorders described in the post, pointing to relationship-related causes."
"Post: This has been going on for years, but it wasn't till today that I noticed it was happening. I get this sence of relief when I reach out towards people to hang out, but they tell me they can't. It happened to me today, I was home alone and craving human contact. I called my friend to see if he wanted to hang out, but he tells me that he couldn't cause he was working. I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out. The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed. Am I the only one that is a mess of contradictions?  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a pattern where the poster reaches out to hang out with people, but they are consistently rejected or unable to meet up. This leads to a sense of relief at first, but then quickly fades and is replaced by depression and a longing for human contact. The post also mentions feeling dread and exhaustion when plans are made and carried out. These contradictory emotions and experiences suggest a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, as well as a struggle to navigate social interactions and find fulfillment in relationships."
"Post: I just don't fucking see how the majority of people aren't fucking poor in the first place. I'm nearly fucking homeless, just barely making it by the skin of my teeth, with little to nothing going for me, with mounting debts, and somehow the majority of fucking people aren't dealing with this shit. I just don't fucking get it. How on Earth did my life turn out to be so fucking shitty, yet somehow most of everyone else is doing way better than me. I know a lot of people in my situation too. I see 'em all around and it's like we're fucking invisible. Nobody gives a shit about us and nobody fucking thinks that the fact that you can end up in this fucking situation in this goddamn country is bad enough to warrant massive change. No one thinks it's a fucking problem because it's only a million or two out of a couple hundred million. In fact, it fucking disgusts me that the majority can just write off ANY human life so easily. Bad fucking credit. No education. Fucking debts. No savings. Identity theft. And somehow this shit doesn't seem to be a fucking problem for most others. The fucking bleakness of the world is almost enough to drive me to go on a mass homicidal rampage. That's just how fucking ridiculous this shit is. I feel like I will never be in a fucking place where I can expect a better quality of life. This shit can only get worse, and I fucking know that it can because I know people who are sleeping outside tonight in fucking DC in their cars because of this shit. I'm not there yet but jesus fucking christ if I ever am some unlucky piece of shit is going to pay horribly for this bullshit. I am not grateful for this life in the least, and I wish death and disaster upon this country, which by it's institutions have run me into a destitution from which I may never fucking emerge. Hopelessness. That's all my life is. A fucking endless feedback loop of fucking problems that leads to one another. I have zero legitimate reasons to even stay alive other than for the fucking hell of it. But I'm not just surviving yet. If I ever get to the point where my life is just trying to survive, I'm going to go out of my way to hurt the rich bastards who keep every cent for themselves, who kill the unfortunate minority no one gives a shit about because they're not them.  Question: This post shows the mental disorder cause of ","jobs and career. Reasoning: The post expresses extreme frustration and hopelessness regarding the poster's financial situation and their perception that the majority of people are not experiencing the same struggles. They mention being almost homeless, having mounting debts, bad credit, no education, and no savings. They also express anger towards the rich and a desire to cause harm to them. These statements suggest that the mental disorders in this post are related to the poster's current job and career situation, as well as their financial struggles and feelings of inequality."
