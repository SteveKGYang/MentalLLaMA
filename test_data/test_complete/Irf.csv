"Post: I have beaten depression before! I really have! But this time for the life of me I can't! I have so much going on. Too much. A lot of heavy burdens but I also have lots of good too. My dad is living in the hospital. My mom had angina. My dad is a VERY COMPLICATED case. My mom's attitude is ""whatever"". And I have two older brothers, one who can't help through no fault of his own he has heart problems. The other can't be counted on, he flys out of province regularly. So often in fact that he doesn't even bother to let family know. I have the most amazing husband ever! He is simply the best thing that's ever happened to me. I have three of the world's most friendly cats. We live in a nice house, cheap rent for what we have. Awesome neighbors.and my favorite weather outside, sunny cold and crisp air with crunchy snow on the ground. But I can't kick this depression. I'm attempting medication finally.

2. The post also talks about having heavy burdens, such as a father living in the hospital and a mother with angina, as well as unreliable siblings. These stressors could potentially contribute to feelings of being a burden, but it is important to note that the post does not explicitly express thoughts of being better off gone.

"Post: Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work.

When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain. While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"".

"Post: Basically, I developed a really big crush on this girl. It was the only time I've ever seen my self being in a relationship. And get this! She had a crush on me too! I was so happy. I was going to ask her out last night at a NYE party, it's the only reason I went. But I missed my chance. Whatever, I'm hanging out with her and some other people tomorrow, I'll ask her then. Never-fucking-mind. I got a text from her a couple hours ago. She said she just wanted to be friends. I respected her, I didn't want to be a creep like a guy from r/incels. I told her I got it. I didn't get it. She liked me last night. I know she did. And today she didn't. I don't get now feelings for a person could come and go like that. The worst part? One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November. I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain. I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts. I just want to be clear, I still want to be her friend. But I still have a crush on her, despite what she made me do. All my old coping mechanisms didn't work. I can't get her out of my head.

3. The individual mentions engaging in self-harm as a way to cope with the emotional pain caused by the rejection. This demonstrates a maladaptive coping mechanism, which can be indicative of experiencing psychological distress due to a lack of connectedness or belongingness.
4. The individual voices a recurring obsession with the girl and difficulty moving on from the rejection. This suggests a preoccupation with the relationship and difficulty detaching oneself from the idea of being in a romantic relationship, potentially indicating a deeper longing for belongingness."

"Post: My dad has had a long history of cheating on my mom, every time though he always denies it. I don't understand it, what exactly is he protecting with his pride? Does he not see what's happening to my mom?! Everyday since Christmas, my mom has been on the verge of tears and my dad still either doesn't notice or doesn't care. The problem is that my mom and I are both powerless because my dad has us under his money. I don't know what to do anymore; we still haven't confronted him about it because (1) he'll just deny it and (2) it's his word against ours. My dads family is wealthy and they're all a bunch of fucking elitists and my dads family protects him like he's an angel. My aunt and brother, in the past, instead of going after my dad for his shit, they instead put all the blame on my mother. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIT PEOPLE?! My mother has been through 2 cancers and survived, had just retired form her stressful office space and now she's being treated like this by some shithead of a father?! Idk what else to do, I just recovered from my depression. I think I might go through with my promise and look for a gun this time around, it seems like a fair escape from all this shit.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: Yes, the post does mention a high level of distress and feelings of powerlessness, but it primarily focuses on the individual's anger towards their father and their family dynamics. While there may be underlying issues of emotional disconnectedness and inadequate belongingness, the individual's main concerns in this post are related to their father's infidelity, their mother's suffering, and their anger towards their family. The mention of feeling like a fair escape from all the problems does raise concerns about potential risk, but it is not explicitly related to a lack of connectedness. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded that there is a clear risk of thwarted belongingness in this post."

Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: 1. The post does mention feeling powerless and not knowing what to do anymore, which can indicate distress and possibly a desire to escape from the situation. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

2. The post expresses anger and frustration towards the father and the family members who blame the mother. While these emotions are understandable given the situation, they do not directly suggest a perception of being a burden on others.

3. The post mentions the individual recovering from depression and contemplating looking for a gun as a possible escape. This statement is concerning and indicates a risk for suicidal ideation, but it does not specifically relate to perceived burdensomeness.

Overall, while the post does contain distressing content and thoughts of escape, there is not enough evidence to conclude a specific risk of perceived burdensomeness. However, it is important to take the individual's expressed distress seriously and encourage them to seek professional help and support."
"Post: I wish I had a person to have a big argument with. Why? Because it‚Äôs a way to let my anger out and that person gets to call me names.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1.

This desire indicates potential pent-up frustrations or negative emotions that are not currently being addressed or expressed.

2. The individual mentions that the person they argue with gets to call them names.

However, the way they express this desire (through arguing and name-calling) may indicate a difficulty in forming and maintaining healthy, constructive relationships.

"Post: PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state.

"Post: Home life is really bad at the moment, both parents are alcoholics and recently their drinking had been getting a lot worse. It's cause both sides of my family to argue due to my parents lack of care over my younger sister. I want to move out but I do not have the money, I don't really have anywhere to go, I want to call social services on my parents (again) but I can't as I'll be kicked out and have my belongings potentially trashed. My parents have never been there for me, I didn't have the best childhood, which has caused me to have an unfortunate array of mental disorders and depression. But now I'm starting to think I'll win the lottery of 1 million and everything will be okay, I keep thinking I'm going to win money and then I can move out and give me and my sister a better life for both of us. It's getting to the point that I'm daydreaming constantly of winning a large sum of money, and that I can get my own place and my sister will be okay. Ive started to genuinely think I'm a millionare. I'm that depressed I'm having unrealistic dreams and thoughts of the future so I don't think of what's happening at home and I don't know what to do. I don't get a lot of money to my self, I cannot get a job due to health/mental health reasons, even though I'd like to work. Everything is getting worse again and it feels like my brain is struggling on ways to cope with it.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1.

3. The individual expresses a belief that winning the lottery will solve their problems and provide a better life for themselves and their sister. This unrealistic daydreaming can be seen as a coping mechanism to escape from their current distressing circumstances, further indicating a potential lack of connectedness and dissatisfaction with their current situation.

This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness as they are experiencing psychological pain as a result of their inadequate connectedness.
Overall, the combination of a dysfunctional home life, financial constraints, unrealistic escape fantasies, and mental health struggles indicates a risk of thwarted belongingness in this post."

"Post: Okay, here it goes. I don‚Äôt really care if this isn‚Äôt a throwaway account, it‚Äôs whatever. During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn‚Äôt care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good. When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i‚Äôve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it‚Äôs only gotten worse. I now spend all time i can get in my room, under a blanket, won‚Äôt call anyone because i don‚Äôt want anyone to hear how bad i sound, don‚Äôt let anyone see me because of how bad i look, etc. I‚Äôve attempted suicide once, and that one time my dad walked in on me trying to hang myself. I‚Äôve given it lots of thought since then, and honestly, every day it feels like a better option. I don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm posting this, something in me told me to post this here.

"Post: For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something. However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled.

"Post: My mom wont stop criticizing the movies and YouTube I watch only for the swearing.. I'm 20 years old.. they really help me with my depression. Especially YMS, movie channels, Michael Reeves.. I swear in private A LOT but never in front of my parents. I just think it's funny how THATS the problem when I feel like fucking garbage... not when i was assaulted (groped) not when i came home crying when i was bullied mercilessly.. not when I cry to her that nobody loves me (literally says I'm being manipulative when I do and I'm doing it for attention) not when I slashed my thighs when she told me that if I didnt graduate college I would be a loser that relys on welfare homeless and a drug addict.

"Post: Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout.

It doesn't help that one of my friends confirmed this by telling me the last time I had a breakdown, one of my friends got upset because I still act ""this way"" even though they're trying they keep ""cheering me up"". One even just gave me advice to just ""help myself"". It feels like they think I'm using the ""I'm depressed"" as an excuse for every breakdown I have.

"Post: Okay everyone hello there, recently I've been having extreme panic attacks and depression.

"Post: Hi everyone, I've been lurking on this reddit for a couple of months now, on and off, depending on my mood. It's always been uplifting to read the responses to the posts. The context of my problem is that I'll be looking for an internship in April of this year (my very first job), and I'm unsure if I can match up to the competition and impress a potential employer. However, that isn't what I wanted help with.

"Post: Just over a week ago I left a really shitty situation with parents who have treated me pretty awfully for years and I am finally free - however, I'm homeless. I have been staying with friends and I spend some time in crisis accommodation provided by my psychologist after I finally opened up to her about everything they have been doing to me, and it's just been really hard. I'm having trouble getting the legal documents I need to secure a stable living situation, in my country so much of that is reliant on parental confirmation even though I am a legal adult, and I met up with my mum today to try and talk things out with her but I got brutalised and put down and just made to feel really worthless all over again. She couldn't even not be cruel to me after meeting for just one day after not seeing eachother for awhile, so I have decided to go no contact. I feel really helpless. I feel like the systems in place quite literally fuck you over if you have abusive families, needing their birth certificates to verify things. I feel like it has been made near impossible for me to live independently without them but I know I can never go back because they have put me through so much trauma and so many things I know to not be okay and they have no remorse, and I'm never going to put up with that ever again.

I have been staying with friends and I spend some time in crisis accommodation provided by my psychologist after I finally opened up to her about everything they have been doing to me, and it's just been really hard. I'm having trouble getting the legal documents I need to secure a stable living situation, in my country so much of that is reliant on parental confirmation even though I am a legal adult, and I met up with my mum today to try and talk things out with her but I got brutalised and put down and just made to feel really worthless all over again. She couldn't even not be cruel to me after meeting for just one day after not seeing eachother for awhile, so I have decided to go no contact. I feel really helpless. I feel like the systems in place quite literally fuck you over if you have abusive families, needing their birth certificates to verify things. I feel like it has been made near impossible for me to live independently without them but I know I can never go back because they have put me through so much trauma and so many things I know to not be okay and they have no remorse, and I'm never going to put up with that ever again. I really don't want to go on anymore, I feel so weak, I have been trying so hard to get everything in order for 10 days straight and it has amounted to nothing, and I really feel like I have no other choice,  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: 
1. The post mentions being in a ""really shitty situation"" with parents who have treated the person awfully for years. This indicates a history of mistreatment and potentially abusive relationships, which can contribute to feelings of low self-worth and perceived burdensomeness.
2. The person states that they are now homeless and struggling to secure stable living arrangements. This lack of stability and support can further exacerbate feelings of helplessness and being a burden.
3. The post expresses frustration with the systems in place that make it difficult to live independently without parental confirmation. This sense of being trapped and dependent on abusive family members can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
4. The person mentions feeling weak and like they have no other choice. These feelings of hopelessness and desperation can be indicators of perceived burdensomeness and a possible risk for considering self-harm or suicide."

2. The language used (""That's it,"" ""nothing else to it"") suggests a sense of resignation, potentially indicating a long-standing belief of not belonging or fitting in.

3. While the post does not explicitly mention thoughts of being better off gone, the feelings of being unwanted and the sense of hopelessness can be indicators of perceived burdensomeness. However, without explicit mention of these thoughts, the label cannot be definitively assigned."

"Post: Hey guys, first time playing here, just wanted to get some opinions. I've been on a variety of antidepressants over the years, and it seems that when my medication is not fully working I get this unwell feeling in my stomach. I'm not sad or unhappy, and it isn't emotionally triggered, there is just this awful feeling my stomach. It's not an upset stomach, it just feels unwell, and it changes my mood because it's all I can focus on. I was on Brintellix for a year and was a miracle drug for me after a year of finding a medication that worked. Symptoms then began about 3 months ago in the form of this unwell feeling in my stomach. We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half. I take 75MG in the morning but the symptoms arise around the early afternoon. Has anyone ever had similar symptoms linked to their depression?  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In this post, the individual is seeking opinions and sharing their experience with antidepressant medication and experiencing physical symptoms.

"Post: I'm not talking about someone saying ""Its all just in your head."" I mean how do you stop someone from flat out denying the existence of depression and anxiety. My girlfriend's parents believe that depression and anxiety are merely excuses to be lazy. Unfortunately, my girlfriend has been diagnosed with both, and when things get bad, her parents actually are a road block to getting better. Her mother actually slightly understands, and lets her take antidepressants (which she hasn't actually been on the last few months because she is too anxious to go to the pharmacy) but when things go bad, she is on the brink of suicide, and her parents will yell at her for sleeping late, or taking too long in the bathroom, and it only makes things worse.

3. The individual expresses their desire for the girlfriend's parents to understand her situation, indicating a need for improved connectedness and validation. This desire for understanding demonstrates the impact of inadequate belongingness and further supports the label of the post showing a risk of thwarted belongingness."

"Post: **CLIFFS--** Was high on life, having good party times. Let it all get to my head, inflated my ego and created an image I wasn't able to maintain. Was pretending to be someone I wasn't. Had a nervous breakdown, sobering event, and lost all my confidence and now am filled with self loathing as if my life has peaked. Doctors diagnosed me with bipolar manic depression 8ish years ago. I tried some medication but didn't like it. Smoked weed to push my problems aside for many years and now they are coming back almost as strong as ever. I don't know how to get comfortable around my peers anymore. I feel like my facial expressions and personality are completely empty and Im having trouble finding myself. All this is making it really tough for me to open up in relationships, especially ones with females my age. Im 28 and its been 8 years since I've been in an intimate situation with a woman. The worst part is, I remember how things used to be. How confident and comfortable I was in my own skin. The attraction from girls I liked. I liked who I was. Now, all I can see is some sad lonely man whos trapped inside his own mind and overly self conscious. I cant stop beating myself up about it. When I look in the mirror, all I see is a sadder, older, uglier version of myself without the personality which got me all the girls in the first place  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Maybe this post belongs in r/anxiety; I'm not quite sure. I do know that lately I've had this feeling that, on several occasions, has made me quite literally sick to my stomach. It's very hard to describe. See, I recently turned 18. I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life. I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve? I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve. Thank you for taking the time.

I feel so lonely, and it keeps getting worse the older I get. Treatment hasn't helped. So if I were to test, if this is infact what is causing it, how could I go about it? In my dreamworld I would have 30min sessions, a couple of times a week where I snuggle to tv-series with a girl. But of course this is impossible to do. What came first the chicken or the egg? Maybe I'm just thinking too much about my depression, it could be very well be that my depression came first which is why it's impossible for me to find a partner.

In my dreamworld I would have 30min sessions, a couple of times a week where I snuggle to tv-series with a girl. But of course this is impossible to do. What came first the chicken or the egg? Maybe I'm just thinking too much about my depression, it could be very well be that my depression came first which is why it's impossible for me to find a partner. Has anyone had several years of no human contact, and then found a bf/gf only to have the depression continue uninterrupted?  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling lonely and attributes the depression to a lack of physical contact with other humans. This indicates a potential interpersonal risk factor for perceived burdensomeness, as loneliness and social isolation can contribute to feelings of being a burden on others. 
2. The post expresses frustration with the lack of improvement from treatment, suggesting a continued struggle with depression. This ongoing depressive state could potentially contribute to perceived burdensomeness. 
3. The post mentions a desire for physical contact and a dream of snuggling with someone while watching TV. This can be interpreted as a longing for intimacy and connection, which can be related to perceived burdensomeness if the individual feels unlovable or unworthy of such relationships. 
4. The post also questions the cause and effect relationship between depression and lack of human contact, suggesting a deep contemplation of their own experiences and potential explanations for their struggles. This internal rumination can contribute to a negative self-perception and increase the risk of perceived burdensomeness. 
Overall, while the post does not explicitly state thoughts of being better off gone, it does exhibit several risk factors for perceived burdensomeness related to interpersonal factors and negative self-perception."

"Post: So I was recently on Snapchat. Well...my sister was. And she came across something, like a reading for 2018. Reading mine, I really thought about what it said. It actually got to me.

3. The post asks how others continue on and who they rely on when facing difficulties, implying a desire for support and guidance. This does not align with perceived burdensomeness, as it suggests a willingness to seek help rather than a belief that one is a burden."
"Post: I was doing so good, the birds all sang in the morning, the aroma of the flowers; I had not been enticed by that smell in such a long time. I had managed to clean my room; got rid of the giant stack of clothes, the water bottle collection and opened up the curtains to let the sun radiate my small lumpy mattress. Lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks from eating right and hitting the gym. Went out of my way to interact with people, like I used to love. I was planning to make a cheesecake with my niece and make strawberry flowers. Then I realized how pointless all THIS is. I‚Äôm NEVER going to be happy. I guess that‚Äôs just how it goes. Like a swing, bro. Now I‚Äôm here indecisive on whether to buy the poison that has released me from the shackles of existence countless other times or return to my prison cell and ‚Äúface it like a man‚Äù. Either way there is no way out.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In this post, the individual describes positive changes in their life, such as enjoying nature, improving their living space, taking care of their physical health, and actively interacting with others.

"Post: After many years of variety of meds for a variety of things (ADHD, depression, sleep, bipolar), I decided to self-medicate with coffee, melatonin, excercise, a therapy light, and running my own business rather than having to follow stupid rules. Actually, the self-medication thing worked pretty well. It probably helps that I've lived with a physician for many years. However, the business did not go well, and I'm back to being full-time employed for someone else.

"Post: Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with. I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions struggling with their mental health for a significant period of time, including a history of self-harm. This suggests a long-standing sense of psychological pain and potential feelings of inadequacy in terms of connectedness.

"Post: Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with. I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions struggling with mental health issues, including a history of self-harm and a current worsening of symptoms. These factors indicate a significant mental disturbance and potential risk for perceived burdensomeness.

2. The post describes social isolation and rejection from friends who no longer want to be around the individual due to their perceived negativity or constant bad mood. This rejection can further contribute to feelings of burden and worthlessness.

3. The post expresses a lack of excitement or happiness in life, with a constant state of indifference or unhappiness. This emotional state aligns with the risk factor of perceived burdensomeness.

4. The post contains explicit thoughts of wanting to die, perceiving it as an easier option and believing that few people would care. These thoughts of suicide and the belief that others would be better off without them reflect a high level of perceived burdensomeness.

5. The post also mentions feeling hesitant to open up to friends, as it becomes a competition of who has it worse and not feeling heard or supported by most people. This lack of support can reinforce the perception of being a burden.

6. The individual has gone as far as writing notes for their closest friend and a few other people, indicating a serious intent to end their life. This further highlights the risk of perceived burdensomeness and the urgency of intervention."
"Post: I don't enjoy the ""nice"" things other people seem to enjoy. Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is ""How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing."" Especially reading a book. Dear God, I could never distract myself from the disconnect I feel inside of me to enjoy reading a book Why don't I get that little rush of dopamine from behavior others find rewarding?  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a sense of disconnect and a lack of enjoyment in activities that others find pleasurable, indicating a potential lack of connectedness and belongingness.
2. They specifically mention how they believe it would be miserable to enjoy these activities alone, suggesting a desire for social connection and potentially feeling inadequate or isolated without it.
3. The individual questions why they do not experience the same feelings of reward and pleasure that others do, which could indicate feelings of inadequacy and discontent with their current level of connectedness."

And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter? To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow. Update: I haven't been able to talk to my mom as she's kind of having a 'quiet time' day and I don't want to bother her. I also have a question. Would it be unhealthy for her if I talk to her? She has anxiety/panic disorder and although she hasn't had a panic attack in several months I don't want to cause her too much stress. (Sorry I didn't mention this before),  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1.

3. The post expresses confusion and disbelief towards people who genuinely enjoy themselves and love themselves. This further highlights a lack of self-worth and a perception of being different from others, which can intensify the experience of perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post repeatedly emphasizes a lack of usefulness and a history of messing things up when trying to be helpful. This reinforces a negative self-perception and a belief that they do not contribute anything meaningful to others, further supporting the presence of perceived burdensomeness.
5. The update also reveals the hesitation to talk to their mother due to concerns about causing her stress, suggesting a sense of responsibility for others' well-being and a fear of burdening them. This is consistent with the interpersonal risk factors associated with perceived burdensomeness.
Overall, the post provides multiple indicators of perceived burdensomeness, including thoughts of not wanting to live, negative self-perception, self-harm behavior, a sense of being different from others, and feeling like a burden to loved ones."

Ive been bullied since grade 1, my father used to bias me when i was young, i was lied too by damn near everyone, lost my mom in 2018, attempted on multiple ocasions, nobody ever fucking listens to me, and im finally past my tipping point. I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life. EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all. I also have medication im going to down before i start to...attempt fully. If I live, I may (cant guarantee) re edit this post. Don't feel bad for me, I've wanted this. I ACTIVELY want this. So, thank you for taking the time to read this (though I doubt itll ever be seen) and goodbye.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The post explicitly mentions feeling suicidal and being at the point of wanting to end their life. This is a strong indicator of perceived burdensomeness and a desire to escape from their perceived struggles.
2. The post mentions experiencing bullying since grade 1, biased treatment from their father, being lied to by multiple people, and the loss of their mother. These negative interpersonal experiences can contribute to feelings of being a burden and fuel the desire to end one's life.
3. The post describes previous suicide attempts and feeling unheard by others. These experiences further reinforce the sense of burdensomeness and contribute to a feeling of hopelessness.
4. The post includes specific plans for taking their life, mentioning the use of a knife and medication. This level of detail indicates a high level of distress and intention to carry out their plan.
Overall, the combination of explicit suicidal thoughts, negative interpersonal experiences, previous suicide attempts, and specific plans for self-harm strongly suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness."
"Post: Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated. Thank you for at least taking the time to read.

"Post: I've been doing the only thing I'm capable of to hold myself in place at this point, which is doing everything I can to ignore it all. My feelings, my life, the dread that comes every single fucking night. I've been overeating to the point of getting sick. I've been spending days and more days barely taking care of myself, and just existing in my home, from which I barely leave for days on end. I've been avoiding this conclusion forever, mostly because I'm so scared of it. I don't think I want to exist. Every single night I try really hard to dream and fantasize about my deepest desires, in a desperate attempt to find a reason to pull myself up and keep going, but lately, I've been giving up so easily. I feel like nothing's is really worth it, and that includes myself. The thought of just ending it keeps coming over and over again, and it's getting harder and harder to fight back. I'm scared. I feel cold and worthless. But what's worse is that I know tomorrow will be exactly the same. I know there are people who love me and do so much for me, and I appreciate every single second they invest on me... But I've been really afraid of the idea that, even tho they try to, they can't really change things or help me in the ways that really matter in the end, like my mental condition, my traumas and the inescapable barrier that is my social class. It's like I'm locked and always will be. And it doesn't seem very hard for me at the moment to believe that I'll end up dying by my own hands at some point.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1.

These indicate a negative self-perception and a lack of hope or purpose in life, which are key components of perceived burdensomeness. 2.

"Post: I've taken the first step to getting help, but it seems that nowhere is taking new patients right now. The psychiatrists that are accepting appointments are booking several months out. Starting this process has been pretty nerve-wracking, and now it seems like I will never get help. This entire process seems impossible. Does anyone have advice for how to book my first appointment? Should I just bite the bullet and wait until April/May to be seen by someone?  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In this post, the individual expresses frustration and discouragement about the process of seeking mental health help. While they mention feeling nervous and uncertain, there is no indication of a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The focus of their post is primarily on the difficulty of finding available appointments and seeking advice on how to proceed with scheduling. The absence of interpersonal risk factors related to connectedness suggests that there is no evidence of risk for thwarted belongingness in this post."

Leaving high school has been very good for me, but I think to some extent I've sabotaged my own recovery and kept myself constantly sad out of fear that if I'm not in need of emotional support that my friends will leave me because I won't have anything to offer.

3. The last sentence of the post suggests that the person keeps their issues to themselves until someone asks, indicating a potential pattern of suppressing their emotions and only opening up when prompted.

"Post: So I went to therapy twice last week with my first therapist. I was upfront with her that I wanted therapy in addition to possible medication (my anxiety is unbearable at times and my depression has gotten a lot worse lately). She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)? I don't have a lot of people I can get support from for a decision like this so i appreciate any help or advice you guys have.

4. The individual mentions not having a lot of people to get support from for a decision like this, which suggests a potential lack of social support or connectedness in their personal life. This further emphasizes the importance of finding appropriate mental health support that aligns with their needs and values.

Overall, the individual's post shows risk of thwarted belongingness due to their mental health struggles, their desire for comprehensive support, and potential barriers to accessing the necessary resources."

I know the internet isn't the best place to be around in a situation like this, but there is still enough hope left in me for me to believe there is someone who can relate to me.

I a'm a very quiet person, don't get much attention, and I spend all my time at home or at school.I'm 17 years old and tonight is my last day of Christmas break, and my last day of childhood since tomorrow is my 18th birthday (technically today since my birthday January 4th and it's already 1:50AM).I have spent my night drinking, smoking, and crying. The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight. Tomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I will be replying to comments tomorrow after school, good night to everyone and I hope you all have as great of a day as I will tomorrow.

"Post: Hi, As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited? My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November. I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"". How to cope? Where to go? Edit: Please don't advertise religion/cults to me.

"Post: I've had a rough two weeks and can't study for shit right now. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone and thoughts of suicide are having a hayday. Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing. My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off. My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses feeling unable to talk to anyone, which suggests a lack of connectedness and potential isolation.

"Post: Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4 years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable. Eventually it got too much for them and they released me. It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination.

"Post: I had a patient who was unconscious due to a large spontaneous brain hemorrhage. I remember just gazing at their face and thinking, they don't feel anything. Nothing can hurt them or make them feel sad. Part of me wondered whether it would just be better if they didn't wake up at all and I realized that I must be very sad at the moment to think in such a way. Of course I want them to wake up, be well again, and for the medical team to strive to save their life. I'm just really in a sad place right now.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In this post, the individual expresses feeling sad and having a momentary thought about the patient's unconscious state. However, this does not necessarily indicate a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The post does not mention feeling isolated, disconnected, or having difficulty forming relationships. The individual's thoughts about the patient can be attributed to their own sadness in the moment rather than a reflection of their overall sense of belongingness."

Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: 1. The post does mention a fleeting thought of whether it would be better if the patient didn't wake up. This thought could be seen as a reflection of perceived burdensomeness, as it implies that the patient's suffering would be alleviated if they didn't exist. However, it is important to note that this thought is immediately countered with a statement expressing a desire for the patient to wake up and for their life to be saved.
2. The post also includes a reflection on the poster's own sadness and acknowledges that they must be in a sad place at the moment to have such thoughts. This suggests that the thought of the patient not waking up is more of a reflection of the poster's own emotional state rather than a deep-seated belief of perceived burdensomeness.
3. Overall, the post does not strongly indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness. It is more focused on the poster's emotional state and the fleeting thought seems to be more of a temporary reflection rather than a consistent belief."

They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species. It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself. I can't fathom having the energy to work, go to school, take care of myself, dedicate time to friends, hygiene, cooking, cleaning, planning, and more all in one day, every day.

"Post: I was wondering if anyone else gets really fucking sick of people complaining about specific years and shit due to one awful thing that happened to them that year.

Yoga and meditation and send awareness got me though that, mostly. Regardles... very very long story continues and I'm not used to things going well so when I have a small problem or inconvenience I react and prepare to be hit by my metaphorical truck..

"Post: Today I was sulking around because I really wanted ramen but if course, since it's New Year's Day, nothing is open. I was already hangry, had made myself some chicken in the oven, but set the heat too low, so it came out frozen.

I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said ""well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression."" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal. I'm trying to let go of this situation now. Trying to cheer myself up by watching some Graham Norton, which usually works, but now there's this huge tightness in my chest and I can't breathe properly. My mom has always been, and for as long as she doesn't open her mind up a little bit, she will always be the most frustrating person to talk to about my depression.

It's so bad that I won't even come out as a lesbian, even though my family is very liberal and have told me multiple times if I was it'd be fine. but being honest/emotional/myself just feels terrifying. Obviously - I've never been in a relationship either because of it. How do I get over this (at least a little bit) so I can get help and medication?? I can't do 6 years. I barely made 5.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions wanting to die and feeling like it's either ""get help or just do it already.""

Yeah celebrities died, blah blah, I'm not being apathetic, they were good people, but how many people actually cared about them? Every single time some big name dies, people fill their facebook statuses talking about how x was a big inspiration for them, how x helped them greatly, thing is, most people didn't give a flying fuck about them in the first place, but virality hit them and they didn't want to feel left out of it, facebook is nothing but a big viral circus for the ego, pseudo friends and ads.

Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me. I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time... Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around.

I don't know what to do and to add to all of this I'm not there with her. I live away from my family and that's made it even harder. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Post: I wanted to die starting in Jan 2018, but things have only gotten worse.

Now I have nothing and am in a far worse position (logistically speaking) to be dealing with any of this.

I'm not sure if this is one of those things where if you have to ask it then there is a definite answer, but I'm not sure if what I experience is truly suicidal thoughts. when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions. I don't really care about anything and many of my thoughts are just wishing I could disappear or wishing I was ""less"" in every possible way. I want to not be alive so I don't feel the emotions I feel. I do not often contemplate different ways to kill myself, it is moreso just wishing I wasn't born in the first place or hoping someday something else will happen to me that makes this decision for me. the majority of my thoughts are wishing I was dead or never born, and even when I'm happy I just wish I could stop feeling and the answer to that to me is death. is the way I'm feeling considered suicidal? thank you for reading. any comment will be appreciated and answered.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling guilty for self-harming and being self-destructive, indicating a negative self-perception and potentially low self-worth, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.

2. The post expresses a desire to not be alive in order to avoid feeling the emotions experienced. This indicates a desire to escape the perceived burdensomeness of the emotions and suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.

"Post: Like the title says, I often times feel like I'm just a side character in the lives of those around me (19 M in college). It sucks.

When I try and share something from my life, I just feel like they shrug me off or ignore me completely. Every day feels like I am growing apart from those around me and needless to say it's not fun.

"Post: I got in two car-totaling wrecks in the final two weeks of 2018. Firstly, I rear-ended someone hard enough to total my mother's car (it was still completely drivable but FUCK ME, right Geico? :); this happened the 19th. Then, I got a rental. And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead. I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to. For everyone else I've just been putting aside my fear and pain and anguish and self-doubt and I've been putting it into my work, finding extra hours and working for bonus etc. Hopefully I'll find a way out of this. Sorry for rambling. I don't want to tell this to anyone else. They just won't listen because both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver despite an otherwise squeaky-clean driving record of four years. I don't know what sign the lord, should he exist, is trying to send me. Maybe it's just to stay off of the road.

"Post: We had a rough day. You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days. But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think. Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. But sometimes it turns into something a little worse. The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful. And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this. We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things. I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal. A bad friend. Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day. Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves. Why people killed themselves. Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue. Maybe it was people like me. Maybe I was a bad person after all. I wish I could've been someone better. So, in that case, I'm sorry.

I have days where I'm in a slightly more positive mood, but generally I just feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical to the point where it stops me doing things.

Anyway I took an NHS depression self-assessment recently and the results suggested that I should go and see my GP. However, I'm seriously doubting whether to do it, I feel like I'd just be a waste of their time. Besides I know that there's a chance that they might suggest taking anti-depressants, and I'm a little reluctant about that given everything that I've heard and read about them and their side effects.

I‚Äôve lost nearly my entire family because of these changes, my wife‚Äôs sister has disowned us, her parents are sort of supportive yet very transphobic. I hate that I have had to choose my wife over the family I grew up with, but I‚Äôd make that choice a million times over, no regrets. My mother has been nothing but cruel and evil. Everyone else is too close to her to reach out or keep in my circle. I don‚Äôt know what the point of my post is. I‚Äôm just so down and don‚Äôt want to vent to my wife right now.

"Post: I'm getting really bad grades in a class I used to be really good at. And in another class I'm being really disorganized losing sheets and not getting homework done on time. Truth is, Im exhausted from the moment I wake up so I'll just sleep when i get home, or I'll need to distract myself with a low effort activity rather than concentrate on homework to calm myself down from wanting to hurt myself. But I'm just lazy right? It's so frustrating being seen as careless when I'm just trying to survive. But my teachers expect me to get over myself because everyone goes through hard times. I'm already seeing a school counsellor who's not helping in any way and it's in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist. Yesterday when I got 2 essays back I got E on both of them and I just wanted to tear my hair out because I'm trying so hard to balance everything out but it's not good enough. Seriously, all I can think about is killing myself and it's good enough that I actually come into school when I dont want anyone to see me because I feel too ugly, and I try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours. I just want everyone to know I have depression and help me out in any way but no. They dont give a shit. So I'll just fail and theyll never know why.

"Post: I **need** this year to be better. I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing. I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage.

"Post: I am a male and am 16 years old, I took biology, chemistry, maths and philosophy for my A levels, and I don't know what to do. I had in mind that I would become a doctor, but then I read, that they have to mostly spend weekends working and work overtime. That made me depressed. I thought I had it all figured but, then I realised that I don't really know anymore if I want to become a doctor. I really don't know that much about myself, but I know that I can't be bothered to work over hours. I like to make songs, and sing, and edit videos, but I really don't know what career to take from those, especially since I have already started a level with those subjects. I was thinking of giving YouTube a go, but my parents most likely won't approve at all. Do I keep doing a medical course or stop? Should I try some new things whilst studying? I really need help, I am starting to just waste my life being depressed and thinking on how good all these social stars get paid, and don't have to go to college, whilst I am here just depressed thinking about my future.

These comparisons can further contribute to a sense of thwarted belongingness and dissatisfaction with one's own path.

"Post: I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more.

I was worried because I've been coming in late or on some days not at all. My depression is getting worse, and I feel like my antidepressant dosage is too low to be effective. I'm not sure which is a bigger black mark on my resume/needing a future recommendation for a job: not showing up to work because I'm having a depressive episode, or ending the internship to spare them from further episodes.

"Post: My boyfriend dumped me on Tuesday night. Yesterday afternoon I was really upset so I asked my ex boyfriend's best friend if we could hang out. We got coffee, talked and laughed about stuff and we made plans to hang out today. Yesterday night I was really upset so I asked him to come over. We got food and went back to my apartment.

"Post: Mindless Self Indulgence - It Gets Worst comes to mind immediately. This song is pretty much my theme song. I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot.

"Post: I want to help my papa, who suffers from obvious depression. He had a pretty tough life: loosing his mother when he was young, my grandfather made him drop out of high school to start working and earn money to leave in the house. He worked from 16 to 45 years. He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after. Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates. At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life. He tries really hard to look like he is ok, but he is depressed like noone I've ever seen. I can't do much by myself since im in college and haven't found a job yet. My brother has, but he prefers to take his SO in vacations. This subreddit has helped me in the past, so please give me opinions on how can I help a truly good man who has had bad luck in life.

"Post: I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise. As the sun approached, rays of orange and blue leapt between low level nimbostratus clouds painting a silky leopard-shaped canvas.

Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. Here's a thought: Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess.. I remember when we fell in love.. I was so stupid. More words.. Just words... There's no one else.. Not that it matters..

"Post: Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor.

Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards?

"Post: On his deathbed in the hospital, he pointed at me, shaking his head and said, ""You're no good."" That was 9 years ago? I've always thought that it was all nonsense, I don't believe in the whole 'dying person's prophecies' as my family calls it. But now that I'm in my early 20s, still plagued with depression, and having a mindset of not wanting to work... I'm starting to worry that I'm starting to turn out as the 'no good' person my grandpa said that I'll become. I know fate is our own to carve, I don't want to get into the whole determinism VS free-will debate but I believe that we should all be responsible for our choices. And right now, although I'm still employed, I have seriously considered quitting several times, and what's my reason? I'm tired of work. Real tired of working. My only consolation is that I'm thrifty and sensible. BUT, my dad spends a lot thanks to his illnesses, cigarettes, lottery and luxurious meals, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE POOR. Sigh... Life is a meaningless trudge, we all die some day, so why can't I die soon? Maybe if I know that I'll die soon, I could quit my job and not worry about saving for retirement! Wishful thinking...

"Post: About two months ago I started working my first retail job at a grocery store chain, and everything was fine until they decided to move me to a different department that I can't stand being in, as well as changing my hours completely. Most people say that the front end isn't that bad, but it is for me. They won't let me move somewhere else, so I decided I wasn't going to deal with it, and ghosted instead of giving a two week notice like you should do. I've been lying this entire week about going to work, and instead I've been reading books on mental illness at my public library and staying there until my ""shift"" is over. My mom wanted to know my shedule for next week, and I showed her that it was empty, meaning they fired me, but I didn't tell her that and she thought they were just giving me the week off, which is an impossibility in retail. I start college in two weeks, and now I won't have a paycheck coming every week, but I can't bring myself to care all that much. I noticed I've been much more reckless when driving by myself lately, too. I almost got T boned after leaving the library yesterday and felt nothing. No fear. Just nothing.

The individual expresses a desire to work at the library because it is usually quiet, which suggests a preference for a particular environment rather than a lack of connection with others. Additionally, while the individual mentions feeling reckless while driving and feeling nothing after almost getting into an accident, this alone does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest thwarted belongingness."

"Post: I don't understand this, I really don't. It feels like I can't make progress. Some days I feel good (better than usual, at least) and others, like today, just feels like I can't do literally anything.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is their need to assert dominance on workers that actually do their jobs so that they don‚Äôt move up/think they came move up. I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of it. My mother is dying, my brother is in jail with schizophrenia and I have no significant other. I‚Äôve been working towards getting into a nursing program and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do if I don‚Äôt get in. I‚Äôve quit drinking but suicidal thoughts sober are... sobering lol. I just feel like life is a joke.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: 1.

"Post: Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something.

It's killing me It's something everyone goes through so I hate to feel so shitty about something that will happen regardless I try to make the most of every second im with them but when I'm with them I can't help but thinking the same thing- they'll be gone one day. It feels impossible to think anything positive and it sucks.

"Post: A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life. Has anyone else felt that way? I've been to my psychiatrist and adjusted my meds and know I'm doing great. I just thought I'd share incase someone can relate.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","no.

On top of it, my biggest stressor, I am drowning in debt, I am unable to find better employment, I live in a rural part of California without transportation, housing is scarce and expensive. My rent was just raised and I don't know how I am going to afford it.. I don't have family to turn to financially. My parents are well into their 70s, enjoying the end of their lives, and my brother is a drug dealer. On top of that my brother lives 5 hours away and my parents two states.. I survived a car accident in December of 2018. It left me carless and in a mountain of debt, on top of my other debts. The debt, the fact I can't seem to save or get ahead, I have no one to turn to, I am not really conventionally attractive either.. I just feel lost, depressed, numb, want the stress to go away, even for a moment. I miss my best friend (passed away just a few months ago, not sure if it was intentional or not but it was definitely an overdose, I was mad at him at the time and pushed him away and encouraged his binging.) The only thing still keeping me here is that I would feel guilty if my dog was left alone for days before my body could be found, and I don't want her to end up in the wrong hands.

"Post: Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The individual in the post describes their friend's struggles with mental health, specifically depression. While the friend is experiencing significant distress and risk of self-harm, the focus of the post is on finding ways to help and support the friend rather than expressing feelings of being disconnected or lacking belongingness. Therefore, the post does not indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness."

"Post: I got diagnosed with a pretty serious autoimmune disease about 5 months ago. The prognosis isn't great. I can take steroids and a few other drugs to halt the progress, but eventually, it's gonna destroy my stomach/GI tract. I might make it to 70, but that's not really realistic. All I know is that my life is going to be painful. It already is, but long term, it's just gonna get worse. For those of y'all with chronic illness, how do you deal with the knowledge that things are only going to get worse? How can you maintain hope when there really isn't any reason to have it? I'm never going to be able to live a normal life. What woman would ever want to date a guy who is gonna die in his 60's? On the off chance that I can have kids without fucking them up with my disease, is it even ethical to do it when I can't commit to being there for them?

"Post: The past two years have taught me never to hope. Hope is a very big mistake to be making.

The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal"" I'm just venting a little. I don't know if this would really make sense to other people, tbh I'm kinda fucked up mentally right now cause school is a bitch. Thx for reading :)  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like a large portion of life has been wasted in school and feeling drained and sad after school. These feelings of dissatisfaction and sadness can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also expresses that school worsens the writer's mental health and anxiety. This suggests that the school environment is negatively impacting their well-being, which can also contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post mentions feeling pressure to conform and a desire to be ""normal."" These feelings of not fitting in and wanting to change oneself can also contribute to perceived burdensomeness.

"Post: They say I have low self-esteem. I say: I have a realistic view of myself and my abilities. It's not about comparing myself to other people. There is always going to be someone better. SomeONES. I'm probably not even average on most of the metrics that matter. It's just... this is who I was ten years ago, and it's going to be who I am twenty years from now. I'm slowly coming to terms with that fact, but it leaves a major question: if this is me, and I'm not worth very much at all, then what justification is there to keep on grinding on, day after day, just to pay some other fucker's mortgage on their third home?

"Post: I have never felt this broken before. My girlfriend and I broke up over a month ago and it hasn't gotten any better.

"Post: I tried making progress on my thesis from a few weeks back but it has been so difficult, not just in a mental state. Ever since I got depression, I have the hardest time focusing on stuff.

I currently don't have the two things that are absolutely crucial for my productivity, which is concentration and memory. I try to bring myself up but it is so freaking hard when my body can't respond back. I guess now I just have to do what I can and try to brace myself for tomorrow, for I am sure to be destroyed during my defense tomorrow.

Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do. My friends are real humans with feelings. I'm ready to invest effort, time and emotions into a friendship that is worth it, even if it's just online :) A little bit about me, I'm a 23 year old female. INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle... But so far I've met some who can handle it :D My interests include writing poems, collecting cute stuff, singing, and thinking about life and possibilities. Anything else you wanna know, find out for yourself! :D  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: 1. The post does not mention feeling like a burden or thoughts of being better off gone. It primarily focuses on the poster's search for a best friend who understands the experience of depression and is supportive. 
2. The post expresses a desire for a strong and meaningful friendship, particularly online, where the poster feels their friends will be taken more seriously. This indicates a need for social connection and support, but does not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness.

Despite friends telling them otherwise, the individual still holds onto these negative feelings, suggesting a potential struggle with feelings of belongingness and acceptance. 3. The post does not mention feeling connected to others or having strong social relationships, further indicating a lack of belongingness."

"Post: I've been going to therapy for about 5 months now and I've noticed some improvements in my anxiety and depression.

"Post: This will sound trivial perhaps but I don't know where else to post it. I got enough friends posting on my wall but there's always that one person you deeply care about that doesn't wish you a happy birthday. Then your mind sorta spirals that they don't care about you, that you love them but they either hate you or couldn't care less about you. It's just the person is special and I'm not, and if I lose her as a friend then I'll never find someone like that again. I don't blame her, I bring all my problems to her and she's deeply caring but I think that's just the way she is. And if I got that happy birthday from her I would probably be relieved for a few minutes but that's it. It's just invalidating that the person I share the most to doesn't even really care about me, but my mind just might be jumping to conclusions. Anyways thanks for listening  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses feeling hurt and invalidated by the fact that someone they deeply care about did not wish them a happy birthday. This suggests a potential disruption or inadequacy in their relationship, which can contribute to feelings of disconnectedness.
2. The individual mentions that if they lose this person as a friend, they believe they will never find someone like them again. This indicates a fear of losing a significant connection and reinforces the importance of connectedness in their life.
3. The individual acknowledges that their mind may be jumping to conclusions, indicating some self-doubt and uncertainty about the situation. This self-doubt can further contribute to feeling inadequate or lacking in belongingness.
Overall, the post demonstrates interpersonal risk factors such as a potential disruption in a significant relationship, fear of losing that connection, and feelings of invalidation, highlighting the presence of thwarted belongingness."

"Post: In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies. Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing. Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already. This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation. The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything. Yet at the same time my presence in her life has been a fairly consistent cause of stress. Another lose-lose. I don't know what to do. I can't live for myself and I can't live for her. But dying isn't an option either right now. My life is a giant Chinese finger trap.  Question: The answer to the question: ""Does the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions spending significant holidays and important occasions alone, highlighting a lack of social connections and potentially inadequate belongingness.
2. They mention experiencing fear and nightmares about losing their only friend, suggesting a high level of distress and emotional pain related to their interpersonal relationships.
3. The individual reveals a chronic vitamin deficiency that may have been affecting their mental health for a long time, which could contribute to a sense of inadequacy or disconnection.
4. They express feeling trapped and unable to find a solution, indicating a sense of hopelessness and potential risk for further thwarted belongingness.
5. The individual mentions concerns about the impact of their presence on their friend's life, suggesting a potential strain on their social relationships and a feeling of burden.

"Post: I've felt this way for a very long time. The feeling of inadequacy, the contempt of others, the anger, and the overwhelming loneliness. For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it. This is my first time admitting to this and I think its easier to admit in anonymity than to my family. They wouldn't understand these feelings and I inevitably chase all of my friends away. I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness. I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of ""okay-ness.""

I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness. I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of ""okay-ness."" Despite everything, I cant say I'm better off and I simply do not want to deal with any of it anymore to be honest. I really want to get better and i hope that this is the first step to that for fear of the alternative.
