"Post: 2017 for me was the equivalent of putting a load of expensive and high-end ingredients into a pot, cooking it, and having it taste rancid in the end. I had such great experiences and growth this year, but it feels like it hasn't given me the fulfilment I really want.

I'm expected to smile and participate in these rituals, even by the people who know me well enough to know that I want to be miles away from anything to do with a holiday.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter. But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come, Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb. I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay. To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown. So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone... Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand. Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband. But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down, To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown. Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do. Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue. That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert, To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt.

I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good. It's mostly guys in there so I feel like there's less of the fakeness you would get from women. I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. I do have other stuff to do. I think I'm about to lose my job so I could apply for jobs, I could play video games, I could learn how football works, workout... This class is just so damn far out of my comfort zone.

I don‚Äôt really have any close friends, I hate my family, I haven‚Äôt been intimate with a girl in 6 years, and i just feel like a complete outsider everywhere I go. I fantasize about awesome ways I could die (eg die trying to save a baby in a burning house) so people don‚Äôt think of me as another victim to depression.

I would go to lengths that would have serious effects on my life just to help this person. It has always been hard for me to trust other people or even have interest in other people, but this person started to feel like a friend to me. It shatters my heart to know that I was never appreciated even after spending so much of my life trying to be a friend for this person when a lot of others wasn't.

"Post: I keep thinking my friends are planning to hurt me. Ever time we hang out I‚Äôm convinced they are speaking in code. I get very frustrated when I can‚Äôt decipher the code. I will eventually get so frustrated that I just demand them to tell me what‚Äôs going on, which results in them telling me they have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. Several times I‚Äôve thought I was going to be publicly shamed by my closest friends. I find harsh insults and threats in their speech that they always claim they didn‚Äôt mean. They always say I‚Äôm paranoid and that I‚Äôm making everything up. On several occasions I thought I was going to be forced to have sex with someone and then later realized I was the only one aware of this.

"Post: Hi guys, I might need some help. I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge. I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them. I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say. So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while. The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression. Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct. Again, I don't know if this was the right place to go, but I had to talk to someone about it.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's reliance on alcohol whenever they feel down, highlighting a potential coping mechanism for dealing with negative emotions.

"Post: I've had severe depression for pretty much my entire life, but that feeling has changed recently. There's now a constant weight in my chest as opposed to only sometimes.

"Post: I usually avoid toxic parts of the internet to not get even more depressed than I already am but someone [linked me to this text](https://i.imgur.com/8SmEePD.png) without telling me how bad it gets (so I'm warning you not to read it if you're feeling particularly bad right now). Some of the text feels like jaded ramblings but other parts feel like a punch in the gut. I'm 31, my career is a trainwreck right now, got no friends anymore nor a SO and parents are getting old so soon I won't even have a family. Parts of this text that talk about social capital really resonate with me since many of the examples it mentions I did experience before but couldn't figure out what was happening at the time. It felt like when you realize nobody was laughing with you but at you. But worst of all is that I have nothing to counter those arguments, in particular the ones in the first half of it. It was a very disturbing reading, at least for me.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of depression, loneliness, and a sense of hopelessness. The poster mentions avoiding toxic parts of the internet to protect their mental health, suggesting that they are already struggling with negative emotions.

Been living at my brother's apartment, but he's throwing me out since I can't make rent anymore. I have 3 dollars and some change, a ps4 and the phone I'm typing this with and that's it. I have nowhere to go. I have no friends whatsoever, and no family that will even give me the time of day. No degrees or certifications. My credit is terrible and I'm several grand in debt.

"Post: I just sent this to my longtime friend and business partner. He knows me better than anyone. ""Did you not see a difference in me on Friday? My vocabulary, my sense of humor, not just one comment, but I saw and responded with timing. You commented on the fluidity of my speech. The way I pushed Kevin from 30 days to 2 weeks instantly? Thinking of the blue tooth ****** camera/app? Sure any one of those things can happen with me, but not all in one day for me for years. I was on my game. It's times like that when I know I have a mental illness. That is me. And I don't get to see it often."" I just had two days of what I guess was a manic episode. I was me and anything was possible.

"Post: I feel really weird doing this. I'm not good at talking about this stuff. But I have a couple reasons to think unloading anonymously might help a little. I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about half my life, since I was in middle school. Had a couple close calls, but had my first genuine attempt last summer. I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today. I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived. I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet. This is hard for me to type. I feel like I'm just an attention seeker. And, hey, maybe I am. I don't know. I don't even feel like I should be posting here. I'm not really an immediate threat to myself. I'm just desperate. This is the hardest night I've had in a while. I just want to feel something else.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post mentions several indicators of loneliness and emotional distress.

"Post: In high school I was depressed. I cried myself to sleep every night and wished I would die over my meaningless woes. I am now 25 and 2017 was the happiest year of my life, but the past week I have been completely unmotivated. I do not want to die, but I have lost all desire to live. I search for joy and find fleeting moments. The love that is right in front of me feels like a far away flame. I watch the days pass me by and sleep seems to be the only thing I enjoy.

"Post: I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way. People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes. (I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive). A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"". But I get told to change. As if I don't deal with my own? It makes no sense. Does anyone else do this? Face isolation because people misunderstand their emotional turmoil? This has caused me great hardship, stress, and mental breakdown. It'd be nice to feel normal. Thank you for reading.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of isolation, misunderstanding, and frustration towards the way others perceive the poster. The mention of being judged based on defense mechanisms and feeling like a permanent smear of mistakes suggests a lack of understanding and acceptance from others, contributing to feelings of loneliness.

I've been watching porn since 9 or I think much more younger than that. I grew up on a terrible family. During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing.. When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it. It made me feel arouse when someone is groping me and I dont know why. That's why in porn, I'm being aroused as well with groping or.. force or worst gang sex whatever they call that. I used to masturbate and still masturbating for it. I dont know why am I so into it even if I know that porn industry is evil and I dont ever want to be raped.

"Post: They say I have low self-esteem. I say: I have a realistic view of myself and my abilities. It's not about comparing myself to other people. There is always going to be someone better. SomeONES. I'm probably not even average on most of the metrics that matter. It's just... this is who I was ten years ago, and it's going to be who I am twenty years from now. I'm slowly coming to terms with that fact, but it leaves a major question: if this is me, and I'm not worth very much at all, then what justification is there to keep on grinding on, day after day, just to pay some other fucker's mortgage on their third home?  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","no.

"Post: I'm new to reddit as of today. Recently, my depression has been super bad and I've been hoping for some other support besides the usual ""but your life seems to be going well"" and ""dont be to hard on yourself"" that I get from my parents. I dont really have anyone I feel I can connect to, so hopefully I can find someone here that is going through something similar. The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given. Hell, im only 17 and I already feel stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that im going to be in stuck in for 2017 and the rest of my fucking life. If anyone is going through even a somewhat similar situation please let me know because i feel so alone with this.

"Post: Not only did I sleep until 2, but I drove to Dairy Queen and spent $10 on fast food. I've also picked 2 new scabs into my face due to anxiety. I forced myself to play Skyrim for an hour, but grew bored rather quickly. I'm also returning to school tomorrow, which I fucking hate. (SPOILER) 2018 is as awful as 2017.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post mentions sleeping until 2, spending money on fast food, picking scabs out of anxiety, and feeling bored while playing a video game. These activities and behaviors suggest a lack of engagement and fulfillment in the poster's life.

The closing sentence '2018 is as awful as 2017' suggests a general pessimistic and negative outlook, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness. While the post does not explicitly mention loneliness, the combination of isolated behaviors, lack of enjoyment, and negative outlook suggest a possible experience of loneliness."
"Post: I'm in my junior year of college and lately my depression has been getting to the point where i can't help but constantly think about either dying somehow or outright killing myself. I can tell that i'm isolating myself from all of my friends. I rarely answer texts and if i'm invited to go out, i either don't respond or make up an excuse. Lots of people have told me they miss seeing me but no one has considered asking me how i'm doing. I feel like i'm being selfish by wanting them to ask me how i am rather than going to them and talking about how badly i'm struggling to just go about my everyday life. I also don't want to go to them with this kind of thing because it's a pretty heavy topic to just bring up out of the blue and i don't want to scare anyone. I don't even know if any of this makes sense so maybe someone else has felt similarly?  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of depression, isolation, and thoughts of self-harm or suicide, which are strong indicators of loneliness. The poster mentions isolating themselves from friends, rarely answering texts, and making excuses to avoid going out, which further suggests a withdrawal from social interactions.

"Post: ive had this sentence typed: im so goddamn tired of and i keep typing things im tired of, then backspacing. things like how im tired of being incredibly lazy and not doing something constructive. or how im tired that i draw like absolute shit and am truly at the bottom rung of a hierarchy of artists. tired of hating me. but its all just meaningless. at the end of the day, im just tired of being tired. i guess theres nothing else to say  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of frustration, self-criticism, and exhaustion, but it does not directly mention feelings of loneliness. The focus of the post is on the poster's dissatisfaction with themselves and their perceived lack of productivity or artistic skill.

"Post: The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to. The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die. I'm afraid that if I don't act now, I'll regret it and have to endure life for another year, but I'm also not 100% set on death just yet.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the poster expresses a desire to die and discusses a specific method of suicide. However, the focus of the post is not on feelings of loneliness but rather on the decision-making process and logistical details of the suicide attempt. While this post may indicate the presence of other mental health issues, loneliness is not the primary emotional state being expressed."
"Post: Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain. A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man. I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful. &amp;#x200B; For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me. &amp;#x200B; I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity. &amp;#x200B; As I am typing this out I feel better. I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident. &amp;#x200B; I just wish it was over.

"Post: So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of frustration and sadness, as well as a feeling of being trapped in a cycle of good and bad days.

The closing statement of wanting to contact everyone and tell them about suicidal thoughts highlights a serious level of distress and a desire for someone to truly care about their well-being. Overall, the post conveys significant feelings of loneliness and a lack of meaningful social connections."
"Post: I have so many things that make me feel sad, especially right now, but I don't talk about them with others, even though I have some lovely friends, because I don't want to place the burden of myself upon them. Even though I have no evidence this will happen I am gripped by the fear that they will think I'm annoying (oversharing?) when I think about telling them this stuff, or I start to think about how maybe they will abandon me if they knew how sad I really was. I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of sadness, fear, and a sense of suffering alone.

"Post: I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling. Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night. I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally? Please help anyone who has gone through something similar or knows someone who has gotten better as I've become a shell of myself.. going from perfect breathing to feeling like I'm walking around with a bag over my head all day is devastating and the real kicker is I'm not even happy with the cosmetic result but at this point I just want to breathe again,,,  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","no.

"Post: Hey. 16M here. I‚Äôm just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I‚Äôve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it‚Äôs started to slow down and I don‚Äôt want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything‚Äôs is so hunky dory. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm alone on this and I doubt I am, but it‚Äôs so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I‚Äôll probably be told that the weed isn‚Äôt helping with my motivation, which it isn‚Äôt, but that isn‚Äôt the issue. My issue is that I don‚Äôt have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? I never do homework, I never study, and these days it‚Äôs actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôd pass with a C or above. But now I‚Äôm getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can‚Äôt find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my ‚Äúeducation‚Äù.

The issue I'm having though is that I feel like a completely different person. In some ways it's good, but I feel like I'm re-learning how to live. Some of my interests have changed, things physically feel different, I don't feel as invested in my relationships, and in a strange way I miss my depression because it was like a comforting imaginary friend that was always there.

"Post: I've found that if I keep my energy up, my other depressive symptoms will go away, if they're not too severe that day. My drug of choice is Red Bull.

"Post: Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3. In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..) I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago.

I have chronic pain that is awful the last few years, relationship problems that he won't work out with me because he chooses to be stubborn and stand offish. I don't know how much more of life I can handle without cracking and shattering. It's been mostly bias and loneliness with a few brief happy moments. I've inherited every crazy gene in the family on top of that. I don't know how much I can take. So I want to shave my head because that will help.. somehow, I don't know. I'm just struggling in general. I don't know how to cope anymore. Journaling helps for a few minutes. Crafting helps for a few minutes. Standing in the sun helps for a few minutes.

I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types. They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time. I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else. My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit.

"Post: I'm an 18 year old with severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder and DID at a point in my life. But I'm slowly recovering. I have always felt like I never belonged to this world, because I am ""too imaginative"" and ""too kind"". I behave ""not like how people should"". I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo. Everyone does. It's final exam time for us, and I have to secure good marks, otherwise I won't be able to enter any good streams in a good college. It would be the end of my future. My family is in a financial crunch, but they give up everything for me. I am dead-set on helping my friends get through their depression and suicidal tendencies, but I'm failing at that. I have had three attempts, but I was saved by a person, who himself was alexithymic (I think) and suicidal. He still is, and he says if he doesn't do well, he will commit suicide. I don't know what I'm gonna do if I don't perform the way I should. But I certainly know that I will die if he does. In case everything goes wrong, I'll leave. There's no other way. The day of my death is nearing. It's just 3 months away. Love you all. Have a good day.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of sadness, despair, and hopelessness, which are often associated with loneliness.

The statements 'I have always felt like I never belonged to this world' and 'I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo' suggest feelings of isolation and not fitting in with others. The mention of failing to help friends with depression and suicidal tendencies and having had three suicide attempts demonstrates a lack of support and connection.

"Post: It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time. The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it. Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a range of emotions and experiences that indicate loneliness. The poster mentions difficulty sleeping and experiencing nightmares, which can be symptoms of anxiety and loneliness. The comment about the poster's husband being ""too good"" to them and feeling unworthy of his love suggests low self-esteem and a lack of belief in one's own worthiness of companionship. The statement about looking out the window and wondering if anyone thinks of them and if they are worthy of friendship further emphasizes feelings of isolation and longing for connection. The mention of therapy and the therapist asking about goals also implies that the poster is actively seeking help and support, likely due to feelings of loneliness. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of loneliness and yearning for meaningful connections with others."
"Post: I took an IQ test on queendom and got a score of 112. That puts me at or near one standard deviation below the engineering fields. The science fields are probably close to that as well. I feel like this is a result of my genetics, my economic background, and my lack of learning things throughout life.

I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I‚Äôm sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. I hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it‚Äôs not family related. Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos.

"Post: let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything"" I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of self-doubt, inadequacy, and frustration towards the best friend. The poster compares themselves to their best friend, highlighting the stark differences in achievements and abilities. They mention feeling like a waste and a piece of shit in comparison to their friend's perfection. The poster also mentions having a difficult home life and struggling with mental health issues, but their best friend dismisses their concerns and belittles their need for medication. They express reluctance to end the friendship due to a lack of other friends and the close relationship between their families. The poster concludes by stating that they feel like the friendship is toxic and that they feel like shit. The overall tone of the post suggests a deep sense of loneliness and isolation, as the poster feels inadequate, unsupported, and trapped in a friendship that is not meeting their emotional needs."
"Post: So I recently went to a therapist, because I have severe depression. I cannot afford to keep going, and I was hoping someone might have some suggestions or exercises in general to stop feeling sad. I‚Äôm looking for things I can do on a daily basis to improve over time. Any help is appreciated!  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: While the post mentions severe depression and a desire for suggestions to stop feeling sad, it does not directly express feelings of loneliness. The focus of the post is more on finding ways to improve mental health and seeking help from others.

"Post: Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post mentions that the friend has gone down a depression spiral, has panic attacks, and has attempted to hurt herself. These are all indicators of mental health struggles, but they do not directly imply loneliness. The poster expresses a desire to help and feels helpless in the situation, but this does not necessarily indicate their own feelings of loneliness. The primary focus of the post is on finding ways to support the friend and seeking suggestions for assistance."
"Post: So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June. I didn't get another job until September. So here i am, only working there a few months, and this is the second time i've done a no call no show within 3 weeks. I can't get myself to get out of bed. I just turned 19. I had to have my mom call off for me the other day because i was having a mental breakdown. The jobs i have are not even stressful, but i'm so terrified to actually CALL and talk to a manager and tell them i can't come in, and it's not like being depressed is a work excuse. I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression? Or have any recommendations on jobs? I take medication, so there's nothing else to really help. I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks..  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post mentions multiple instances of not showing up to work and having a mental breakdown.

"Post: I've been going through a rough patch. I was recently diagnosed with mild depression and GAD and have worry reduction group therapy in a few weeks. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk or turn to without feeling guilty or like I am making a meal out of how i'm feeling. I try and help people who have more stressful things going on as a distraction technique but I am now feeling like I should just stop messaging or contacting people because at least then, I wont feel guilty about bothering someone. I have tried monitoring sleep but that has stopped and I am sleeping less. I tried a mood diary app on my phone but that last about a month. I also tried coming off facebook for a few weeks, but didn't notice much difference. I'm at a bit of a stand still with regards of what to do.

Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is ""How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing.""

"Post: I hate that you have no defense when someone disagrees with you. ""It's your depression talking."" No, shithead, maybe you're treating me like crap and I have a legitimate reason to be unhappy about that. Except you have to defend that because the immediate assumption is you being negative - and you're not even sure yourself. You practically help them gaslight you. I hate that the only people who talk to you are miserable failures like yourself, talking about being miserable failures. What you need is a way out of hell, not more company there. And most functional people either don't know what the hell is like, or having left, can't go near it for fear of being dragged back. I know I wouldn't want to. I hate that it fills you with so much energy and takes away any ability to release it. I hate that your choices with most new people are to be a non-entity, or a drain on their energy because they have to deal with you. I hate that for most of the medications I've tried anyway, it doesn't take away the sad, it merely allows you to function through it. Even if it does, it ultimately isn't enough if you don't have at least a bit of genuine happiness to hold on to. I hate that you start to despise the coping mechanisms that you develop.

"Post: What I mean by this, is that they care to hear how you're doing and stuff, and they do care of your existence. For example, if you fall ill, they may say something like ""Well, I hope ____ feels better soon!"" That kind of thing. But a lot of people don't care about you, they care *of* you. If they aren't the kind of person who talks and listens to you, then I feel like that means they only care of you. I have a bunch of family members who I only talk to when I see them, like on holidays. Those people, unfortunately, don't care about me. They care of me. I feel like there's a difference. I don't know if know if these are warbled depression thoughts, or if I'm just realizing this, but it seems to be the case. I know telling people about depression is usually overwhelming, but I can't help but feel so brushed off. I hate when I tell people stuff like ""I'm not feeling too well lately, and my life has gotten pretty rough,"" and they'll simply dismiss it with an ""Oh, okay.""

My life continued for others, never myself. Yesterday my father explained to me how much I've affected people - in this moment I was faced with the truth I put off for more than 11 years. Being alive hurts people - financially, emotionally and physically. The only reason I am alive has been conflicted - this is when I realized I was fucked.

"Post: I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then. About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there. Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing. When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her. I think if I fuck up and constantly bug her about things, that she'll be closer to the door. I guess I'm just feeling shitty today and I wish I could just change it. Hope all of you are trying to stay positive as well.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","no.

When I was finished I just looked at it and knew it was a mistake, now I‚Äôm going to have to hide it till it heals. No sex, no beach/pool trips, no shorts (the weather is always warm where I live so even though it‚Äôs winter these things are still an option for me) ...

The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful. And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this. We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things. I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal. A bad friend. Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day. Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves. Why people killed themselves. Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue. Maybe it was people like me.

I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it.

You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all.

To make matters worse, a guy I used to talk to that was flirting with a good friend of mine and now I'm anxious that they think that's why I was upset when really my depression just felt like it was a good time to kick in. Which brings me to my severe social anxiety.......long spiraling story short I've only gotten out of bed once today to make a sandwich, ate said sandwich in bed and went back to sleep.

"Post: Anyways, I know that you guys aren't doctors, but I have a question. I am on medication, but yet all day long, I feel panic, trouble breathing and shaking all day for like no reason. I can't identify any of the stressors, it just comes on and makes me really tense, irritable, etc. I can't even really identify anything I'm scared of, I just feel like my body is having a biological reaction and is creating tension.

"Post: This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing. Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it. And still no one asking about me in the main chat. It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier. This is just cruel. I'm not looking forward to our next game when I have to be around them...  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of exclusion, hurt, and disappointment.

"Post: Perpetually asked if you're ok and always respond with "" I'm fine "". It's pathetic I know, but I always just want someone to reach out and just know that I'm not fine. Obviously, this will never happen... but I have too much pride to ever tell someone I need help. I can't tell my parents because I fear their judgment. I can't tell my friends because none are close enough and even if they were... they wouldn't care. They'd care on the surface, but the next day it's back to their lives and that's that. That doesn't make them bad friends...I'd probably be the same way. Everyone has their own problems they don't need to be hassled with mine. I don't know what I'm looking for with this post or if I'm even looking for anything. I guess it's more for me... to just tell someone... even if it's just to one of you random people that actually read this. I've never told anyone how I really feel or ever even posted something like this anonymously, but here I am. Thanks to anyone who listened. For anyone who feels somewhat similar...

I've been at the edge for a long time now, but I'm just exhausted at this point. I just can't. Why does life have to be like this? Why can't we just be happy all the time?

You feel like you‚Äôre dying inside or you very much have a desire to not live anymore. I know that pain and how real it is. However, just know that with the right doctor and the right combination of medications, it will subside almost completely. If you‚Äôre constantly feeling this pain, then something is clearly wrong with your treatment. Just know that it does get better. It does get easier.

I don't know why my depression is so bad today, not sure if it's the new year and the prospect of going around again with the same old bullshit of being rejected or the amount of happy couples I saw today.

I am quite aware of the progress I made the past few months and I have even considered myself depression-free until I had an episode after feeling very stable for three weeks.

"Post: I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit. A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it's not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you. And then there's bigger things. Like being 5'2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can't even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO. It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I'm actually excited for because I'm just in that mindset that it'll go wrong because of my bad luck.

"Post: Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice?

"Post: Spent all day on the phone with my family crying. I‚Äôm not sure I have the strength to carry on anymore. I‚Äôve had to be ‚Äústrong‚Äù for such a long time and I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve been thinking about dying for a really long time. Multiple times a day, and after a lot of research I‚Äôve sort of unofficially settled on hanging in the absence of a better method. I realized I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to suspend from so that‚Äôs been a deterrent for most of this (or I should say last) year. But today I realized my door is high enough and sturdy enough to hang myself from and I‚Äôve been crying all day and feeling at rock bottom so I decided to test a possible hanging rig. I got my scarf around my neck and tightened it to the point that my face felt swollen and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Kept it for a few seconds until my heart started to pound suddenly so I undid it. It wasn‚Äôt as unpleasant as I thought it would be. It wasn‚Äôt great but it was surprisingly not as unpleasant as I had always anticipated. This doesn‚Äôt give me hope in a weird way because you‚Äôd think feeling so desperate and so hopeless for so long, the potential of ending this suffering might bring relief but I think it‚Äôs more that I‚Äôve lost all ability to feel any kind of hope.

"Post: after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago). my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit. I'm afraid of freezing up and being incapable of speaking honestly. but knowing this is my anxiety speaking, it'll probably go well and be over before I know it... or it could seem to last an eternity and I'll feel trapped the whole time, as per usual. don't know why I've typed this. guess it would be nice to receive some advice, experiences, what to say, etc. not expecting replies though. gonna take a hot shower, then ponder about this until I fall asleep. goodnight. edit: wording.

"Post: Everything I've had in life has slowly been ruined by anxiety. Friends I used to talk with constantly are now either gone or distant because I just can't keep up with them anymore. I've separated from so much of my family because of my own choices and shitty habits. I'm unable to beat them. For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud. I've lost every job the same way. Whether it's throwing up in the bathrooms at work or failing to muster up the courage to even call in sick, it finds its place in the worst possible ways without fail. It's been like this for years. I live at home with no job, no car, not even highschool degree four years after I should have graduated. I don't even have a driver's licence. I've been hospitalized twice, both times in relation to this problem that just won't go away. Nothing works. Every day I'm met with opportunities but pass on every single one of them. I'm young, I'm healthy, and I know I'm still capable. I have so many choices and yet it feels like there are none anymore.

"Post: I seriously have so much anxiety in me going on that I can‚Äôt stand it any more, only thing I do is lay in bed and do nothing at all. I am diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and take medicine but it does not help. I had a lot of therapy but nothing helped. All my thoughts are going round the same topic: what can I do today to help myself? Meditation? Active things? Take a bath? Read a book? What should I do?!?! And this repeats till I go to bed again and my results are that I did nothing. Lol. How can I break this crazy cycle?  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is "," yes. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a lot of anxiety and not being able to handle it.

"Post: After many years of variety of meds for a variety of things (ADHD, depression, sleep, bipolar), I decided to self-medicate with coffee, melatonin, excercise, a therapy light, and running my own business rather than having to follow stupid rules. Actually, the self-medication thing worked pretty well. It probably helps that I've lived with a physician for many years. However, the business did not go well, and I'm back to being full-time employed for someone else. Basically, I'd need to make an appointment in St. Paul before work or after work, but I'd prefer weekends.

I want someone to hold me and prove me wrong and tell me that I‚Äôm valued and not worthless. When I‚Äôm alone, all I have are shitty thoughts and memories that tell me how worthless I am.

"Post: I really cannot do this anymore. It's like my suffering has spread onto those I love and I'm at a point where I can no longer put on a fake smile. I can no longer pretend that I'm okay because I'm not. I hate seeing my friends and family hurt for me and it breaks my heart seeing them feel so helpless. My life is such a failure and I've already ruined it so much that there's literally no point in going on. I fall asleep crying every night because I realized that I'm the problem here and my existence only makes the lives of others worse. People keep telling me how much they love me and how much I have to live for and while that does mean something to me, it's not enough to make me want to live. With my existence, I hurt people and with my death, I'll hurt people, so what's the point? At least if I die eventually the hurt will begin to fade (or so I hope). I just want the people I love to live a life without worries or hurt and all I do is hurt them. I have 2 more weeks to finish this quarter of school. Before I decide to end my ""wonderful"" life I just want to finish this one quarter, not that I'm going to achieve anything. I just want to push through these last 2 weeks but even that's been extremely difficult.

"Post: Mindless Self Indulgence - It Gets Worst comes to mind immediately. This song is pretty much my theme song. I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot. Behemoth, Shade Empire, Dimmu Borgir, Hate. Great bands. Since I am usually not happy, I rather sit and listen to music that is about death, destruction, hatred, pain, misanthorpy, war, and satanism. All the dark shit. I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace. It fits in with usually how I feel. If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless. Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place. I should have my vocal cords removed.

Because I refuse to take medication or be ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù and the only other person who understands is my friend, who is also suicidal.

I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through!

But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind. I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide.

A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn‚Äôt want me to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made they‚Äôre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together. Afterwards they said it was the most beautiful New Year‚Äôs Eve they‚Äôve ever had and same applies to me because I‚Äôm used to spending it alone and having a breakdown. I am just so happy and it‚Äôs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her.

"Post: I guess this isn‚Äôt really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so they‚Äôll never experience that sadness. But ever since I‚Äôve been depressed (roughly 5 years now) I‚Äôve been the most cynical person. I hate other people‚Äôs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside I‚Äôm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore.

"Post: 2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing. Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma.

"Post: On NYE, I downloaded a habit tracking app. I had tried to make a paper notebook one but just couldn't be motivated to do it. Technology to the rescue! Yes, it's only be 3 days. And no new habits have been formed. But it's been a good way to make sure I'm doing all the self care things I've been setting aside when I'm having a bad day: flossing, washing face, brushing teeth, drinking enough water, taking Vitamin D etc. At the end of the day (or before work if I'm working swing shift) I go over the list, see what else I can do. There's a nice little feeling of accomplishment when I press the check mark. That's how I'm going to beat this, how I'm going to get to where I feel like I want to live, one small accomplishment at a time.

"Post: I‚Äôve tried a lot of medicines over the past 2 years, even a combination of some, but ultimately I stopped taking them around September because I didn‚Äôt feel like I should have been taking as much as I was for as little result as I was getting. Things have surprisingly been going really well since I stopped medication BUT I still struggle with anxiety on a daily basis. Mostly overthinking everything and just letting my thoughts get the best of me. I have a really good dr. His son struggles with depression so he‚Äôs more familiar with mental health issues then your generic pediatrician. He‚Äôs kept me away from some of the more high risk medicines, but also takes into consideration what I have to say based on how I feel and the research I‚Äôve done.

"Post: I feel like a machine. I'm just functioning. I'm not happy anymore, I don't enjoy my hobbies, I don't enjoy drawing or painting, everything just doesn't make sense to me. I'm afraid of moving out, leaving my beloved cat behind, my dad and everything I've ever known. There will be so many changes.. Of course I love the thought of living with my boyfriend and I love our apartment, but I just feel like there's a tight grip around me. On New Years Eve, I told my boyfriend that I feel bad, that I'm wishing to have a car accident, that I just want everything to stop. He got angry, told me that I'm selfish and that I should stop with these thoughts. I would never ever kill myself, I could never do it. So no worries. I started hurting myself again, biting my arms, biting my lips. Nobody knows how I feel. Nobody. I feel alone even if I have a wonderful boyfriend and good friends.

"Post: I always feared people's judgement. I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider. I always kept to myself. No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either. I was in the middle, not bad enough to be hated, not good enough to be loved. I was content with this position for a while, but it was lonely. I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends. I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough. The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people. I have seen how people treat others who are different. They can be mean and cruel. Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise. I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it. People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself? I worry they would think I am weird and annoying, even though I don't mean to be at all. I just want to be accepted and appreciated as I am, but I worry people won't agree with that.

But probably a month or two ago I got into a really bummed out state where I just needed support to get through it. But what did they do, pushed me away and said we don‚Äôt like being with you when you are sad because it brings the rest of us Down. That of course made me even sadder and they stopped inviting me to hang out with them after school and it‚Äôs really really hard for me.

I feel like I am two people right now. One version is ready to go and has a solid plan for how to do it. The other version is horrified and sick at this. I am preventing myself from acting by reminding myself of how much I'm needed at work tomorrow, by thinking of how dependent my pet cat is on me, by imagining how much this will hurt my friends. The two sides are battling it out. I don't think I'll act on my suicidal thoughts tonight, but I may within the next few days. I don't know what to do. I'm broke and can't handle an ER bill.

"Post: I‚Äôm still young. I can get along alright enough with people. I‚Äôm average looking. But I have no friends. I have people that I hang out with, have fun with, but nobody that I really connect with. I don‚Äôt have that person that you can lean on, that you could trust with secrets, that you could just sit and be fine. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do either. Any time I try to imagine the future, I‚Äôm just met with this crushing weight and I just wonder if it would be better to just kill myself instead of trying. And then their are my mistakes. All I can see when I look back at my life are a series of mistakes. So many fucking mistakes. Does anyone else ever fantasize about just dissapearing and starting over? Or just cutting all ties and pretending to disappear so you can kill yourself? Or wish that you could just be natural, just be your fucking self with anybody, literally anybody? Or just do anything right. Just to have a purpose. A fucking purpose. Life just seems so meaningless. Like what the fuck is the point.

"Post: For years leading up to this point, I had been eating healthy, exercising, I had friends and was doing well in my life, had no major health problems. I almost never get sick (even now). I'm comically healthy. All my vitamin levels are good. At the start of this crisis, my doctor raved about my amazing cholesterol numbers, thyroid was good etc. etc. So, It doesn't correlate to events in my life, or to my ""actual"" feelings, or to my physical health. So why did I get cripplingly depressed all of a sudden? The brief period where I was exposed to just a little too much lead as a kid? When I fell on my head and got a crack in my skull at age 2? My parents don't eat that healthy and I didn't start eating right until my teens. I have psoriasis so technically I have an inflammatory disease. Is it one of these things??

"Post: My depression has always involved a lot of self blame, guilt, and self hatred, as well as anger and emptiness. I would always take it out on myself, first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill, then cutting myself, which eventually stemmed into burning, scratching, and punching walls, but recently I've been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past, and especially my old school, where a lot of very bad events happened to me. I'm having urges to sneak in one day (school is out where I live currently) and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything I can find in that shithole. I'm past the point of caring anymore, if I get caught and arrested I'll just kill myself, I just can't give a shit about anything anymore, I'm feeling more and more risky and I feel like I have to do this.

And for what? To build this life over my span of consciousness just to have it all disappear and mean nothing when I die? Life is painful. I feel like I have to fake emotions and reactions to things just to get through the day looking ""normal"" to everyone around me. This inescapable feeling of hopelessness just won't go away. No matter what I do. I try and change something and it still hangs over me. I feel like no one will understand the way I feel. I can't even fully understand it, let alone put it into words. I can't even bring myself to end it all because I think of how much it would hurt the only family I still have left.

"Post: Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression! I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world.

But guess fucking what? He's the favorite of my family. My grandpa and grandma, though they would never admit, clearly favorite him quite a lot compared to my sister, cousins and myself. Every time I go to a family dinner it's anything but family time because a huge argument always occurs at the table, which causes my grandma or aunt to get upset and cry. I don't know why they always have to argue over something. Also, I'm going to art school in the fall and nobody takes my art passion at all serious because I'm not choosing to follow the same typical conventional path as everyone else and become a lawyer/doctor/teacher or something similar.

I feel bad about decisions I make, feelings I have, the place I am in life. I want someone to talk to and tell me I'm not a fuck up, but I don't want to admit things to people I know. I have a wonderful girlfriend, who is understanding and kind and non judgmental, but I don't know what to say to her, or anyone really. Frequently I can just shove the bad feelings away, but somehow I feel like ignoring them isn't healthy, but embracing/acknowledging them feels like crap too. I don't know. I'm just tired of it.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling ""shitty"" while alone and feeling bad about decisions, emotions, and their current life situation. The poster expresses a desire for someone to talk to and validate their feelings, but also mentions not wanting to admit things to people they know. This suggests a lack of social support or someone to confide in, contributing to feelings of loneliness.

"Post: I'm a lonely person but right now I don't have any friends or at least anyone I hang out with or talk to on a regular basis. I'm unemployed and living with my mom. So it feels like I couldn't hide those facts and I don't think any girl would be able to ignore all the red flags. That and I haven't dated anyone recently and my dating experience at the age of 33 is pretty spotty. Never been in a relationship either. Right now I feel like I need to focus on getting a job and getting back in shape because I've fallen off the wagon a bit. Also, I probably should try to get into some sort of activity where I could make some friends. Although, it feels like no one wants to make new friends the older you get.

"Post: i‚Äôve always been the type to be super unmotivated when doing things whether it‚Äôs my ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù or school and super introverted and not confident at all, but last year i joined a pageant and it really brought my confidence up for a while. I‚Äôm going to sound super conceited when i say this but during practice and rehearsals, the other girls were always asking me for advice on their walk and poses and saying that for sure i would win something. during the competition on nye i didn‚Äôt make any mistakes with choreography and a few judges even came over and told me i was their number one pick for queen. there were 12 girls in the competition and 6 awards total. in the end i didn‚Äôt win anything.... once again i‚Äôm going to sound so conceited but i personally felt super confident and i thought there was no way i would not get anything. but lo and behold i didn‚Äôt win a single thing. I basically have solid evidence that 4/6 of the winners had hella connections and sponsors and that‚Äôs why they won. but still... it just feels like i‚Äôve wasted so much time and effort on something that was rigged in the first place. i was thinking that it would be like ‚Äúnew year new me i might actually work harder for some things because winning would be proof that something can come out of it if i try hard enough‚Äù.... but now my confidence is at an all time low and idk what to do.... sorry just felt like ranting a bit sigh  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","no.

"Post: So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared. You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it. TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is "," no. Reasoning: This post does not directly express feelings of loneliness.

"Post: I'm not talking about someone saying ""Its all just in your head."" I mean how do you stop someone from flat out denying the existence of depression and anxiety. My girlfriend's parents believe that depression and anxiety are merely excuses to be lazy. Unfortunately, my girlfriend has been diagnosed with both, and when things get bad, her parents actually are a road block to getting better. Her mother actually slightly understands, and lets her take antidepressants (which she hasn't actually been on the last few months because she is too anxious to go to the pharmacy) but when things go bad, she is on the brink of suicide, and her parents will yell at her for sleeping late, or taking too long in the bathroom, and it only makes things worse. I only want the best for her, and I think getting her parents to understand her situation may help.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post discusses the frustration of dealing with someone who denies the existence of depression and anxiety. The poster mentions their girlfriend being diagnosed with both conditions and the negative impact her parents have on her mental health.

"Post: I'm exhausted, I have been for years. If I'm not exhausted it's because I'm running on adrenaline. For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own. It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression. I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most. I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken. And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me. Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence. Sure I'm great at being outwardly confident should I be at work sorting problems out, or in charge of a bunch of people whist running an event. I can take the lead when I have to. But on a relational level my confidence lacks so much, be it with friends or romantically.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from loneliness?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me. I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time... Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply ""break up"" with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier.

Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started.

Despite all this since about the age of 10 I‚Äôve wished I was never born and would rather be dead. Really the only thing keeping me from suicide is that I don‚Äôt want to put my family/ loved ones through that pain. This may be decent enough to keep me alive but still isn‚Äôt much of a viewpoint to live from, there are times I resent my family because I have to endure the pain and stress of life just because of them. I would just much rather be dead than go through the stress of living and working for the rest of my life, call it depression or laziness or whatever but it‚Äôs just my viewpoint in life and I can‚Äôt shake it.

"Post: So I went to therapy twice last week with my first therapist. I was upfront with her that I wanted therapy in addition to possible medication (my anxiety is unbearable at times and my depression has gotten a lot worse lately). She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)?

Yeah celebrities died, blah blah, I'm not being apathetic, they were good people, but how many people actually cared about them? Every single time some big name dies, people fill their facebook statuses talking about how x was a big inspiration for them, how x helped them greatly, thing is, most people didn't give a flying fuck about them in the first place, but virality hit them and they didn't want to feel left out of it, facebook is nothing but a big viral circus for the ego, pseudo friends and ads. I'm tired of being told my depression is chemical inbalance or some other bs, I love life, but I'm tired of being pointed as the culprit because for sure I'm trying, how many times I messaged facebook ""friends"" and they were downer as fuck, only replying with fillers or excuses, nobody wants to hang out, most people don't want to really connect anymore, they want to live out their digital identities in real life, real socialization is basically dead, everyone is racing towards who's got the ""better"" social condition, who's got more likes? who's got more photos? I'm not exaggerating, instead of a simple gathering, hanging out, doing fun stuff, chat about life, everyone now hangs out to chat about other people, chat about material crap, chat about bs, chat about how they got fucked x amount of girls, or how they achieved y stuff, really fuck off with this crap, everyone likes to conversate about mundane crap, people don't want to exchange ideias, they wanna show off.

I'm trying but with depression is really hard. You know what I get for trying? My phone and videogames taken away. I can't fall asleep at night because of anxiety. You know what I get for having nightly panic attacks? Yelled at for ""staying up all night."" You know what I get for having trouble keeping my room clean? Grounded.

"Post: I got a great internship that will look good on my resume. I had my first day today and I honestly don't know how I will make it through the next four months.

I don‚Äôt want to suffer for the rest of my life, but I also don‚Äôt want others to suffer for my ‚Äúselfish‚Äù choice. I hated growing up, biasd, everyday insults for something that I didnt do. I hated going home and then going back to school feeling different and separated from everyone else. I rushed life, I didnt do anything important growing up, I had amazing friends that I love and who also are the reason that I‚Äôm still here. I was always told that I didnt know anything, and maybe I don‚Äôt, maybe this is a foolish choice, maybe theres a hell. I feel like my life is just going into a dead end.

I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years and they don't hardly know anything about what is really going on in my life. Especially not with my depression. My SO has been pulling away from me and left me all alone last night because she didn't want to sit home with me and had already made plans with someone without me and didn't even mention anything until she was leaving.

"Post: Debt is high. Work sucks. I feel alone in the world. I have thought about suicide almost every day of my life for thirty years. But I never can find the courage to actually do it. And here I am circling the drain again. I just feel like all of the stress and all of the unhappiness and depression will be gone if I just .... cease. I spent this afternoon researching methods. I even did a performative thing with a belt around my neck. Turns tour it slips out of the doorjamb. I know how to tie a noose and a couple kinds of slipknot.

It's becoming difficult not to discuss it with others or bring it up during conversations, especially because it's on my mind 24/7, it's the most remarkable thing that will happen to me probably ever. This probably sounds like an egotistical rant ""I, I, I, me, me, me"", but I do not care, for too long my life has been dictated by other people and factors out of my control and in my last 15 days, I'm gonna fucking focus on myself, nobody and nothing else matters to me now (when have I ever mattered to them?)
