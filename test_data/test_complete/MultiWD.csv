I can't really say I'm looking forward to it, or to the future in general, but the sheer pressure from my mom to get a job and her absolute misunderstanding of how work makes me feel is getting unbearable. She means well. She loves me; I love her. But she cannot grasp this thing. I know she has mild anxiety, but I don't think this feeling of intense social anxiety is something she can understand. Working makes me absolutely fucking *miserable*. I've been in therapy for the past few months, but I can't say it's been doing much. I was feeling lighter overall recently until I realized that I had to get a job if I wanted to live up to my parents' expectations, go to college, and not be a pathetic fuck-up. So I want medication. I need it. I don't fucking care about the side effects, about how I ""need to take them alongside CBT."" Whatever. I want this feeling to go away, or at least to lessen. I can't FUCKING live like this. I'm going to mention it to my mom and my therapist as soon as possible. Whatever numbs the fucking pain, I'll take it.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the intellectual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is "," no.

While there is mention of going to college and meeting parental expectations, there is no indication of engaging in intellectual or cultural activities.

"Post: Hi, 23 M have been living with depression for at least 8 years, maybe longer i've kinda forgotten when it started its been so long. Been at the tipping point for a while now, although for some reason my death would upset some people so i refuse to do it as much as i want to. Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live. The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help? Like i don't actually like this world and even if my attitude changed my situation wouldn't, and if anything relying on pure hope to get me through another 50~ years of despair would just be more painful than accepting it?

"Post: I wish it would go away. My brain struggles to handle the fact that nothing matters and becomes disgusted with things like religion that give hope. Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless. Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control. I had no choice in my existence. Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for. I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events. How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me? I guess I'll try to answer for myself. I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose. Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough. I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess. I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard. Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first. As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate. The real struggle is to create something more. I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.

"Post: I've been going out with her for a little bit. She's told me she loves me a lot, but the past couple months i've made her feel unwanted. After she told me this and basically hinted that she wants this to be over, I realized that I have some deep rooted issues. I'm not happy (with myself), I haven't been happy for over a decade. I've faked it for so long, but I just hid all my unhappiness and now it's starting to come to me. I haven't wanted to wake up, I don't want to kill myself, but I don't care to live. Being alive just feels like my punishment for being a bad person. Here's this beautiful and great girl who loves me, and I've pushed her to the side and made her feel unwanted. Just so I can spend time by myself, alone, with my thoughts, because that should be how I feel. Alone and awful. And I hurt her in the process. She may be over me soon....but I won't be over her for a long time. And I need to let her go, I need to let her out of my toxic orbit. It hurts to know I've lost one of my best friends, but it's the only way I know how to get over someone. She deserves better than me anyway. TL:DR?

"Post: Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it. Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all. It's nearly 3:00 a.m. where I am and my depression has been hitting me rock hard lately. I figured I'd get around to posting on here sometime.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

The focus is on advocating for empathy and understanding towards others who are suffering.

"Post: I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course? Not to mention the huge fear I have that he'll just blow up at me, which I highly doubt is going to happen because he's a very nice person, but I still worry about stuff like that.

"Post: Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past. I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning. Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... Now, here comes the real problem... A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook. Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning. Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... Now, here comes the real problem... A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook. Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

"Post: Hi! Was just with my therapist and she suggested that when depression says ‚Äòisolate yourself from your friends and family‚Äô, do the exact opposite. Seek them out. When anxiety says ‚Äòavoid all your problems‚Äô, face them head on. Depression has a way of convincing you that only the worst things are true. Tell your inner saboteurs to kindly fuck off! You deserve much better. This is much easier said than done, but if you‚Äôre like me and you enjoy being a contrary little bitch, be a contrary little bitch to depression!

"Post: This is my first ever post on reddit. A friend of mine said I should post here and I‚Äôve been finding every excuse not to but I am afraid that I have nothing left so why not? Here goes....I‚Äôve literally given everything I have to my marriage and I‚Äôm not getting anything in return. We have 4 amazing children together and they are everything to me but often times I feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they realize I‚Äôm not worth their time and they too move on from me. I found out my wife was cheating on me and for some reason I still wanted to work things out with her. Well fast forward 4 months later and things are happening with another guy. Every confrontation about it is basically flipped and I‚Äôm made to feel like this is all my fault. I‚Äôve never cheated on her and I‚Äôve never thought about it a single time. I‚Äôm feeling so low that I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I feel like a stranger in my own home. People tell me to think of my children but what good is that when you truly believe they will be better off without you? I‚Äôm not worth trying to make a marriage work so why would I be worth it to them? They didn‚Äôt even choose me. I attempted suicide before, just before Christmas. My sister-in-law found me and called 911 and I ended up in a hospital for a week. I promised I would never let that happen again but I just can‚Äôt help the thoughts coming back. I don‚Äôt see a way out and I have nothing left to give.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

"Post: I‚Äôm frustrated with my life. I have very few friends, and as a 20 year old college student about to turn 21 it‚Äôs driving me crazy to realize that I can‚Äôt celebrate it with anyone. My closest friends are all younger than me, and 2 of the closest are 16 (don‚Äôt worry, I met them through my job, I‚Äôm not a pedophile), so I feel pathetic for being unable to make friends my own age. It‚Äôs just plain creepy. Only thing that keeps people from calling me out is that I look only a year older than them. I‚Äôm gay, in a hyper conservative family, so I can‚Äôt please anyone in it. I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I‚Äôm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I‚Äôm gay, I‚Äôm a pedophile. The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting. I try approaching the LGBT groups on campus but I feel like they‚Äôll ostracize me for other reasons. I feel like I was cheated my teenage years by my restrictive parents, now I‚Äôm lonely and angry at everyone around me for having what I couldn‚Äôt. My siblings are successful, and I feel like the dissappointment and failure of the family.

"Post: I‚Äôm pissed off at my depression. It comes and goes and every time it comes back, IT‚ÄôS WORSE. I hate how I talk to a therapist every two weeks and I‚Äôm not diagnosed with depression. I cry every night and feel so alone. I‚Äôve isolated myself from others in order to heal. I go to the gym 4 days a week, I eat healthy, I try to do some chores and self care too. I don‚Äôt know if I need meds because apparently I show signs of willingness so I don‚Äôt need them. I‚Äôm pissed that I am consumed by chronic sadness every day and night, 24/7. I‚Äôm also pissed that I have no supportive people besides my parents and cousin. Perhaps I‚Äôm ungrateful. I‚Äôd rather end it all tbh. Nothing in this life is exciting and at 21, life should be fun, exciting, wild, laid-back, etc. As a young woman, I should be excited for what‚Äôs to come. I should be excited for having a wonderful life but I am not. I absolutely hate my self and my life. Nothing is helping, not even talking to others. The only person who can help me is me and nothing is working.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In the post, the individual expresses feelings of anger, sadness, and frustration but does not specifically mention a search for meaning or purpose in their existence. The focus is on their struggle with depression and feeling isolated and unsupported, rather than seeking a deeper understanding of life's purpose.

"Post: So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself, I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it. It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like, well, what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve. Would I crumple into a depressed mess or rise to the occasion and be strong for the rest of my family? Who would care if I died? So many questions all the time. Anyone else constantly have death on the brain?  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: In the post, the individual consistently expresses thoughts and preoccupations with death, both their own and others'. They mention thinking about scenarios where they are hit by a bus or have terminal cancer and constantly think about different situations where people in their life die tragically. This preoccupation with death indicates a deep contemplation about the meaning and purpose of life, as well as the emotions and existential questions that come with it. The individual also mentions their thoughts on how they would grieve and the impact of their death on others, which suggests a search for understanding and meaning in relation to their own mortality. This focus on death and existential questions aligns with the spiritual aspect of Dunn's model, as it reflects a search for meaning and purpose in human existence beyond the physical realm."

"Post: There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better. I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me. But the thing is, the thought of having someone just sit with me while I am dying inside -- I mean, I seriously can't even bear it. As much as I would be willing to do that for someone else, I simply cannot accept being on the receiving end of it. What is that? It would be such a comfort to be so wholly accepted, to be so free of expectations and disappointment and pressure; but I can't even imagine it without spinning out. Anyway.

"Post: I have so many things that make me feel sad, especially right now, but I don't talk about them with others, even though I have some lovely friends, because I don't want to place the burden of myself upon them. Even though I have no evidence this will happen I am gripped by the fear that they will think I'm annoying (oversharing?) when I think about telling them this stuff, or I start to think about how maybe they will abandon me if they knew how sad I really was. I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In the post, the individual expresses feelings of sadness, fear, and loneliness, but there is no mention of a search for meaning or purpose in human existence.

Additionally, their mention of contemplating suicide indicates a need for immediate professional help, as it suggests a lack of overall well-being in multiple dimensions of wellness, including mental and emotional health."

"Post: Jan. 17, 2017 I told myself I was sick of going through every year wanting to die, wishing for death, and that if things hadn't changed I wouldn't see the start of 2018. For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point.

"Post: 8 months ago, the love of my life left me. I put everything I had into salvaging the relationship, but in the end even offering to uproot my whole life for her, it wasn't enough. I sunk really low, but I had a friend who helped me through it and did everything in his power to help me out. I went to theropy for a bit but found it far more stressful than useful, so I turned to self help books. I started to think more positively, have a bit, more confidence in my self, and felt like I genuinely self improved. That countied until a few days ago. I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well. After farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up.

"Post: 8 months ago, the love of my life left me. I put everything I had into salvaging the relationship, but in the end even offering to uproot my whole life for her, it wasn't enough. I sunk really low, but I had a friend who helped me through it and did everything in his power to help me out. I went to theropy for a bit but found it far more stressful than useful, so I turned to self help books. I started to think more positively, have a bit, more confidence in my self, and felt like I genuinely self improved. That countied until a few days ago. I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well. After farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up.

We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half.

"Post: So, hey. I'm coming to this sub because... I feel empty, again. I just took my antidepressant for the day, and I still feel like depression is creeping in. About two months ago, I stopped going to school. It was either that or, you know, a mistake. I had to breathe. Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day. A few months ago I was doing amazing things, considering becoming something i'd never even dreamed of. Now, I have all of the possibilities for a better future, and yet i'm sinking in the terrible depths of my stupid brain. I can't come back to a regular sleeping schedule ; I keep thinking wht I should do today, etc. But then, my brain stops me : ""Why bother ? Nothing is important. Your success, your creation, doesn't impact anyone. And even if it did, it would be but a speck on billions of people. You're just trying to fill your time until you grow old and ultimately be alone.

That it was something adults told me when I was young, I just rolled with it until the truth hit like a wall. And yet, my most happiest times were when I felt dumber. That I ignored the reality.

"Post: 22m. I take treatment for anxiety and depression.

"Post: Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.

I'm already seeing a school counsellor who's not helping in any way and it's in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist. Yesterday when I got 2 essays back I got E on both of them and I just wanted to tear my hair out because I'm trying so hard to balance everything out but it's not good enough. Seriously, all I can think about is killing myself and it's good enough that I actually come into school when I dont want anyone to see me because I feel too ugly, and I try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours. I just want everyone to know I have depression and help me out in any way but no. They dont give a shit. So I'll just fail and theyll never know why.

"Post: 2015 was the exact same as 2016. 2014 was the exact same as 2013. I feel like I'm in fucking limbo and I am invisible. I never get invited for things on new years. Also, nothing ever changes. Nothing in my life changes each year. I feel like I meet with the same people, do the same things, eat the same things, never get luck with romance, etc. It's all a waste of fucking time! Why waste time to celebrate the same year with the same shit as the last. I never get out of the same places, people, and situations. It's all the same. I hate it. The only thing I enjoy is getting drunk on the new years and that's it. I'm only 19 and I feel like nothing will change in my life. My life will probably be the same when I'm 30 years fucking old. Nothing exciting. Every girl rejects me that I like. Every guy rejects me that I like. No romance. Nothing. Well, good night. I hope you all had a great new years and I hope you all have a great year. I don't my own year cause I know it will be the same.

"Post: I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.

"Post: I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out.

"Post: I feel really weird doing this. I'm not good at talking about this stuff. But I have a couple reasons to think unloading anonymously might help a little. I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about half my life, since I was in middle school. Had a couple close calls, but had my first genuine attempt last summer. I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today. I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived. I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet. This is hard for me to type. I feel like I'm just an attention seeker. And, hey, maybe I am. I don't know. I don't even feel like I should be posting here. I'm not really an immediate threat to myself. I'm just desperate. This is the hardest night I've had in a while. I just want to feel something else.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In the post, the individual expresses their struggle with depression, suicidal thoughts, and feelings of self-loathing.

The focus is on their emotional state and desperate desire for relief, rather than on seeking a deeper sense of meaning. Therefore, the wellness dimension of the spiritual aspect is not present in this post according to Dunn's model."

"Post: I **need** this year to be better. I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing. I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage. Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

"Post: 2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing. Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma. Half of me keeps slapping my weak and fragile other half, but I'm not making any steps forward.

"Post: Sometimes i get these waves of immense sadness. I remember having them as a kid. It doesn't occur that often now as it did then.

"Post: Hello Reddit depression, I wonder if sometimes anybody else feels like this is the only channel that they have to communicate with other people honestly. I mean Reddit in general not just the sub Reddit depression. I post a lot on Reddit and I post about a lot of things that are personal to me that concern me and then have a large impact on my feelings. I have been diagnosed with generalized depression and anxiety. I am not suicidal but I feel like lately I am very apathetic about life in general. And while I don't really have a bunch of positive messages to spew Into The Ether I know that there are reasons to continue on. I know that the New Year can bring a lot of Hope to some people but can also bring a lot of dread and negativity to some also. So I'm going to ask you what are some things that you are not looking forward to in the upcoming year? I am not looking forward to continuing to be a very supportive and caring partner to somebody that isn't very good at expressing their appreciation or acknowledgement of it. That is not to say that they are a bad person. It is just that sometimes things get hectic and it is hard to see all of the little thing that somebody does for you to make your life easier. So seriously what are some things that you are worried or anxious about for the upcoming year? What do you hope that you can do better? Or what are you hoping that other people can do for you? Are you hoping for something?  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

"Post: For half a year now I'm fighting a fight I can't seem to win. It's like I never even turned 19 this summer. I started university this fall and got together with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She was so supportive and caring that she was afraid to speak about her own problems. She broke up with me because of that a week ago. I made her feel worse, it's my fault she broke up with me. The whole second half of 2016 is a blur.

"Post: As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would. Thank you for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated. -A  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would. Thank you for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated. -A  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the intellectual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

The individual mainly discusses their struggles with depression, feelings of isolation, and thoughts of self-harm. There is no mention of engaging in intellectual or cultural activities, suggesting a lack of focus on the intellectual aspect of psychological wellness."

"Post: Hey, I've struggled hard with depression and I'm currently grieving a suicide of a loved one. Not feeling too great at the moment. I'm offering a song to any of you who want one. I will write and record a song about you or about any topic you would like. It will be free and with the hopes that it makes your life a little bit better, even just for a moment.

"Post: I really don't know if this is the appropriate sub-reddit for this but I find it really funny when I become suicidal.

I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology. I am now in this state of wanting to kill myself (again) but is too lazy to get a knife downstairs.

"Post: In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on. At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months. In between, I picked up lifting weights, practiced meditation, and my acne cleared up. Fast forward 5 years, I am completely happy. I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided. But I know that depressions don't go away with time, and that's what I'm worried about. So was I suffering from clinical depression in 2014? Or was it just circumstantial thing?  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

Therefore, while the post does touch on the spiritual aspect of wellness by mentioning the search for meaning, it does not fully reflect this dimension as the focus is more on the individual's past struggles and current concerns rather than ongoing exploration of spiritual fulfillment."

"Post: Hi all, been having on/off therapy past 3 years for anxiety+depression and more recently for PTSD. Been aiming to be a better person and all that crap.

Anyhow, I'm really feeling like I'm not getting anywhere ATM so I'm giving up on the therapy and meds and feel better already but not sure if its too healthy.

"Post: Hey ya'll. Happy New Year! I want to recover from depression, but have an odd conundrum. I've been depressed all of my adult life and I worry if I get better from this, what if I do not like the new version of myself?

Has anyone felt like this, and if so how did you approach the recovery process? I cannot afford medication or therapy so I am in the process of making my own plan of action to help me out until I can find a therapist on a sliding scale (the waiting lists are a bitch where I live for this sort of thing).

"Post: Hey ya'll. Happy New Year! I want to recover from depression, but have an odd conundrum. I've been depressed all of my adult life and I worry if I get better from this, what if I do not like the new version of myself? I guess I don't know what part of my personality is a mental illness and what part is actually who I am, and so if I tame the mental illness then what if I don't like the version of me that's left? Has anyone felt like this, and if so how did you approach the recovery process? I cannot afford medication or therapy so I am in the process of making my own plan of action to help me out until I can find a therapist on a sliding scale (the waiting lists are a bitch where I live for this sort of thing).

"Post: I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself. I haven‚Äôt been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms. Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, ‚Äúdid that even help if you stopped going?‚Äù He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school‚Äôs records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right now‚Äù I'm moving to a new city soon, so I really feel scared about how I'm going to support myself.

"Post: I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself. I haven‚Äôt been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms. Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, ‚Äúdid that even help if you stopped going?‚Äù He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school‚Äôs records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right now‚Äù I'm moving to a new city soon, so I really feel scared about how I'm going to support myself. As someone who's generally self-sufficient this was sort of a heavy blow, since I really need someone to talk to.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the physical wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is "," no. Reasoning: Although the post discusses the individual seeking therapy and their concerns about their mental health, there is no mention of the physical aspect of wellness. The focus is primarily on their emotional well-being and their need for support and someone to talk to. There is no mention of growth, changes in the body, or the adoption of healthy habits."

"Post: Another thing. My mom recommended I consider a grief therapy group or just a normal therapy group. I don't think I'm still grieving but I might be. I was in a process group many times, but I only sometimes felt okay with it. Some of the others had an idea of what I deal with, as far as crippling depression and at the time, a bad home life. But they didn't have DID or BPD. At this point it's either one ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. And the therapists, it didn't seem like they really knew how to help, like maybe they have had a personality case before but not on my level. I'm actually considering getting back into a group. Who knows, maybe this time they can actually help. I'm trying to not be so closed off. That's how it gets worse. Start shifting personalities and when I interact with my mom or anyone calling me, it's me but not me. Hope that makes sense. Hope you guys are having a comfortable day, sending good vibes your way.

"Post: I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise. Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again. I know that particular symptom varies from person to person, so I wanted to know about others' experiences with those classes of antidepressants and if symptoms varied from drug to drug, even within the same class.

"Post: My parents are divorced since I was 3. No big deal, many people started off worse. I've been living with my mom and rarely meet my dad because I'm too busy. Recently, I met up with my dad and my foster mother, and they thought I might have some psychological problems. Not severe, but still. They wanted to get me checked out. But my mom don't agree. She thought the other parents were overreacting. Personally I do feel off balance at times, and I WOULD get myself tested just to see if I'm okay or not. But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it. I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue. But I still feel really upset with the fact that mom wouldn't get me any help even though it costs her nothing. Thanks for reading, I know there are people being in way worse situations than I am, but I just need to take this off my mind.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

"Post: Like the title says, I often times feel like I'm just a side character in the lives of those around me (19 M in college). It sucks. I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 months ago after struggling to convince myself I needed help for about 2 years, and it just kind of feels like despite trying to be more present in the lives of those around me I end up hurt and ignored no matter what I try. For example, I have tried to get into the habit of asking my roommates what they've been up to recently, how their day is going, if they want to get food, etc., and it just kinda feels like they don't have the time or motivation to reciprocate. When I try and share something from my life, I just feel like they shrug me off or ignore me completely. Every day feels like I am growing apart from those around me and needless to say it's not fun. I am introverted by nature, so socializing can often be exhausting, so I guess it's just even more insulting when those around me blow me off despite the colossal effort it can take to even say hello.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

"Post: Hey guys, this is my first post in a long time back on reddit because I quit for awhile to try and sort myself out. Well life has hit me really hard again lately, so here I am.

For instance, I hated going on vacations with my family. I did not find them fun at all. I hated going to amusement parks and field trips because everyone around me would be having so much fun and I just couldn‚Äôt. I rarely got excited on any holiday except a little bit on Christmas because it was the only time of year when everything around me seemed to calm down and people seemed to be genuinely nice to each other. I never thought my birthday was a big deal and never wanted parties, even though I had a good amount of friends.

"Post: First time on antidepressants but I've been on them for 4 months now. I like the meds I'm on now and if I have an issue then I'll make an appointment with my psychiatrist is what I thought. But when I called my pharmacy they said I was out of refills. Is there any way I can just keep getting refills without having to keep visiting my Dr to renew the prescription? Is there a reason why I need to keep seeing this psychiatrist just to sit in a waiting room for 2 hours just to say hey I need refills?

"Post: That's what I truly want, I want people to prove to me that they want me around, that they appreciate my time.

"Post: Hi guys, Looking for any help I can get! I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.) I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember. I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked. Would love to know if anyone else has been in this situation.. I don't know what to do. :( This whole experience just makes me want to jump in front of a truck. All because I wanted to get off these medal before I have kids..  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no. Reasoning: In the post, the individual is discussing their experience with tapering off medication and the negative side effects they are experiencing. While they express feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, there is no mention of searching for meaning or purpose in human existence. The focus of the post is on the physical and emotional toll of the medication withdrawal, rather than a spiritual aspect. Therefore, the post does not reflect the wellness dimension of the spiritual aspect according to Dunn's model."

Against all the odds, I managed to befriend two great guys, one with an incredibly positive posture and one that shares my pain. I've been thinking a lot, as always.. and maybe things can change now. I am changing habits, thinking stuff through and making solid routines. Maybe I'm not such a waste of space. What I mean is, I've been there. And even though it seems like the cause of the suffering will never go away... There is a way to cope with it. In a healthy way. Maybe you are right that nobody can change your mind about your existential crisis. If God doesn't exist, then there is no right or wrong etc, etc. I still haven't changed my mind. But maybe, just maybe, I can still be happy. I guess this was just a vent or something. I don't know. It may sound cliche, but my change in view coincided with the new year's eve, so I may as well grab the chance. Happy 2017 for you all, and don't be shy to tell yourself to change to the better, even slightly.

"Post: Hi all, I‚Äôve dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and CBT. However I‚Äôve had 3 failed shoulder surgeries since 2016 and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself. I can‚Äôt play basketball anymore which I loved, I have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well. When I try something that I can no longer do (our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway) it usually means I will be down for the rest of the day. I know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but I often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries.

"Post: I normally work out a lot but last year was so bad I even cancelled my gym membership.

"Post: I mean y'all over the internet are great because you generally know what to say as opposed to the average human, but damn. My best friends are fed up with me at this point and they don't even try to understand what's going on, instead blaming me for my behavior. My furry orange guy always comes up to me when I'm lying down and lies on my chest, puts his arms and head into my neck. He just lies there and purrs and purrs and doesn't say anything about how I'm bringing him down. This is why I'm not even ashamed to say I'm going to be a crazy cat lady (I kind of already am at 20). Anyone else in the same boat? I wish humans would show their support in the same way, albeit not literally lying on my chest, lol.

"Post: Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far: I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. Sex drive has plummeted. Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness. I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post.

"Post: Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far: I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. Sex drive has plummeted. Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness. I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post. I hate myself and genuinely don't want to die but I can't see any other options. I just want someone to love me  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the vocational wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is "," yes.

"Post: Hi, everyone. I thank you in advance for reading this post. I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me.

In the last weeks my suicidal thoughts have increased by alot and anxiety and an uncomfortable feeling in my chest has increased too. I just want to get comforted by someone (I would prefer my crush lol) I dont want to sound desperate but is here anyone who can try to make me feel better? My emotional pain has grown by alot recently and often times I just want to die but I cant kill myself because I dont want to hurt my close ones. Please help me :( Edit: Idk if anything Im writing makes sense but I just feel so hopeless and I kind of want to fight against it but most of the time I dont feel like I even have enough power to reach out for help and just let myself drown in my despair and pain.

"Post: Good Evening, everyone. I landed a job interview tomorrow. It's my first job interview since I got fired from my old job and checked into a mental institution/rehab February 2017. I've been clean and sober since the 23rd of February, and got on a mixture of different antidepressants (Lexapro, Mirtazapine, Seroquel). I'm anxious as hell and I feel like I'll fuck this up. I really hope not. The starting pay is a little higher than my old job and I actually get benefits with this new opportunity. Hell, even the work hours are great. I just can't shake the feeling I'll fuck up. I really don't want to fuck it up. I feel like my medication has been helping for the most part, but shit. I still can't get the idea that I'm a fucking hopeless drug addict out of my head. That I don't fucking deserve a second chance at doing something in my life. Wish me luck, everyone.

I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore.

I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore. I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better. I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear.

I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear. I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method. I don't know. I just feel as if today is going to be my last.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the physical wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

"Post: I really don‚Äôt have any evidence on this, but I have this feeling my GF cheated (or still is) on me. I have told her about this and we try different things to strengthen the trust again but nothing really works. This is ruining our relationship that was going great until this. It all started with me thinking that my friend and her were very friendly with each other, plus they shared a lot in common. That idea grew in my head at one point I had convinced myself it was true. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not I confronted both of them, but of course they denied it. Doesn‚Äôt help that my friend is always lying about things (small things at times) and after telling him the situation he hated me and began acting like a dick and showed me a side of him I never knew. I understand people will do and say things that they don‚Äôt mean when mad but he said some mean things lol. We ended up talking things out after I almost fought him because of the slimy shit he did. At the time I thought it was real but now I think it was to avoid the fight.  Question: The answer to the question ""Does the spiritual wellness dimension exists in the post?"" is ","no.

I have several life threatening issues that my parents ignored the obvious early signs of, so my life is severely shortened. And I can barely walk. (No real solution for this one. Besides, you know, ending things myself before I become trapped in my body.) 2.) Shitty in-laws. It's VERY bad. Spent almost a decade patiently convincing my SO that they hate him. Because they do. (Either I keep trying to convince him to stop feeling obligated for people who mistreat him ..or I leave.) 3.) Poverty level. (Randomly succeed at life and afford to live WOW SO EASY AMIRITE. My solution is to keep leaving below my means. Start gambling safely and see what extra money I can come up with.) 4.) No dependable friends. I talk to people easily. Most suck. Most enjoy suffering and pity points. I want people around me where we all want to SOLVE our depression/etc. (Keep trying to establish long-term friendship with people. It's basically endless, time-consuming shopping that we all have to do.) I've been depressed for about 20 years now. I'm pretty good at distracting myself and finding happiness in the tiniest things.

"Post: So... I've wanted to kill myself for the longest. I've even made several failed attempts. I've prayed to God for death. For Him to take me in my sleep. And every morning after that, when I wake up, I cried because I still exist. I have grown to ultimately hate myself. I feel like the most trash ass human being... When I try to express this to other people, it will either be met with the ""tough love"" reprimand, or I end up pushing that person away because of my negative energy. I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again... I just want to be happy, man. I want to be who I was before I figured out I was raised in CPS, who I was before being orphaned, who I was before being the state's property and another statistic. Why the fuck am I still alive?
